Containing the virus is essential. You must stay home and obey the rules of the lockdown. But you should not take your mental health for granted. It has been proven that stress and anxiety can lower your immunity and cause many bodily problems like blood pressure.\n\n## Want to know how to deal with stress and anxiety? You'll find the tips given below very helpful.\n\n### 1. Stick to Your Routine\n\nIt is a lockdown. You cannot attend college lectures, catch up with friends, or visit the neighbors. But that does not mean you must let yourself fall off the routine. Maintaining healthy eating and sleeping habit is essential, especially during this global health crisis. Disruptive or lack of sleep will lower your immunity. So, sleep and eat on time.\n\n### 2. Be Respectful of Your Family\n\nBeing at home 24 hours can cause friction between the family members. You may feel irritated and frustrated. The solution is simple: talk to your family. Request them to give you your privacy and space. It could be as simple as asking them to knock before entering your bedroom. Do not pick up fights over small issues. Work towards solving the problems instead of pointing them out. Remember, a stressful home means a stressed-out mind.\n\n### 3. Cut Down on News\n\nDo not watch Coronavirus related news all day. Watching the news for 30 minutes is more than enough to gather all the information about the ongoing lockdown. Try to stay away from fake, unverified updates. Request your friends and relatives to not send you fake and misleading cures for Coronavirus on WhatsApp.\n\n### 4. Connect With Friends\n\nYes, friends make everything better. Try to connect with them daily. Thankfully, there is no lockdown on the internet. Plan a group video call with your friends through WhatsApp or Hangouts and talk to them about everything other than the ongoing pandemic.\n\n### 5. Pick Up a Hobby\n\nLearn a new skill or start an old hobby again. Maybe you loved to paint and had to stop because of a hectic college schedule, why not utilize this time to paint again? Or perhaps you wanted to learn French. Maybe you like illustrating fashion. Check online for free courses such as Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) [Fashion Design Illustration course](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/niit-1992/fashion-design-illustrations). Get searching and get started!\n\n### 6. Meditate\n\nIt is one of the simplest ways of managing stress during the lockdown. Close your eyes and put on some calming music on your headphones. Focus on your breathing and mind your thoughts. Just 20 minutes of meditation will help you beat the negativity and keep your calm.\n\n### 7. Practice Gratitude\n\nAt such times, it is easy to complain about the things you cannot control. However, focus on the positive: the well-being of your loved ones, a roof over your head, and food on your table. Being grateful will improve your mental well-being immensely.\n\n### 8. Talk To An Expert\n\nDo not be reluctant to seek help. If talking to friends and family is not helping your anxiety, speak to a professional psychologist. There are many psychologists providing consultation on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp. Know that you are not alone. The entire world is going through this with you.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Coronavirus Anxiety, Lockdown Anxiety, Managing Stress, Deal with Stress, Stress During Lockdown\n\n",

For female entrepreneurs, things are not just difficult; they are downright difficult, especially in a nation dominated by men. Here, women are still seen as emotional, less ambitious, and unfit to take the initiative and turn a project into a successful business.\n\nBut today's women are changing this reality. They are breaking mindsets and proving their worth in every industry. Even when running a successful business, they are on par with men. Several successful women have repeatedly demonstrated it with their **inspiring stories.**\n\nOne such example is the** motivational story of Mahananda**, who was raised in a traditional family. She was asked to put her plans for further education on hold and choose marriage over her dreams. At the age of 17, she married as per the wishes of her family.\n\nUnfortunately, her marriage was short-lived. She left her abusive husband and took her children along with her. After realizing their terrible choice, her family encouraged her to pursue higher education. Mahananda has a bachelor’s degree in arts and is skilled in computers too.\n\nThen, in 2019, Mahananda started her computer institute and began her entrepreneurial journey.\n\n\"It's crucial to be financially independent, and I feel pride and accomplishment in supporting my family financially,\" says Mahananda.\n\nIn 2020, she recognised a market for sanitary napkins in her village. She conducted a thorough investigation into the equipment and the raw materials. Later that year, she opened her sanitary napkin manufacturing facility after obtaining a loan of INR 10 lakhs through the \"**Stree Swabhiman**\" programme. She works there with five other people and produces nearly 50,000 sanitary pads monthly.\n\nSince 2015, Mahananda has been associated with the Internet Saathi Programme. She was the only female nominee from her village for the programme coordinator position and was later recognised as the best coordinator in her district.\n\nThe enthusiastic businesswoman also collaborated with fellow Internet Saathi to market and sold Stree Swabhiman sanitary products. On Women's Day, she gave out 150 packets of free sanitary pads to students and distributed the same at a summit for village entrepreneurs!\n\nHer venture has gained consumers' respect and favor in just a short period. Her clients include NGOs from Bangalore and Gulbarga, the Abudya Trust, and her neighboring villages of Alanda, Chikkaballapur, and Gotur.\n\nShe has doubled her monthly income thanks to her education and hard work. She now has another important objective: to provide affordable, environmentally friendly sanitary napkins to women in rural and urban areas.\n\nLike Mahananda, many single moms are taking control of their lives. Along with managing successful businesses/careers, they also look after their families. Nothing is more powerful than a strong, independent woman. You'll start to see your dreams come true the day you decide to pursue them. All you need to do is have confidence in yourself and move forward.**If you are a single mother wanting to realize your dreams of running a successful business, then Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) can provide tips, expert [guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance), and advice; **[click here](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/blog/category/success-stories) for more information.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** mahananda, Inspiring Story, motivational story, stree swabhiman, Success Stories, Inspirational Women in India\n\n",

These dedicated professionals are the backbone and heart of India's healthcare, reshaping the narrative and ensuring a robust system prioritising the nation's well-being.\n\n**Nursing leadership** has historically been overshadowed, but today, women are emerging as key figures, steering the course of healthcare in India. As **women in healthcare leadership**, they bring a unique perspective, combining compassion with strategic acumen to navigate the complexities of the [healthcare sector](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=healthcare).\n\nThe significance of **women in healthcare** leadership roles is not just a statistical shift; it signifies a qualitative transformation in how healthcare is managed and delivered. These leaders oversee day-to-day operations and champion initiatives prioritising preventive care, mental health, and holistic well-being.\n\n**Women's health specialists**' contribution to nursing leadership cannot be understated. In a country as diverse as India, addressing women's health concerns requires a nuanced understanding of cultural, social, and economic factors. Women leaders in healthcare bring this awareness to the forefront, ensuring that healthcare is tailored to the specific needs of women across different regions.\n\nOne key aspect of this transformation is the emphasis on preventive care and community health. Women leaders in nursing understand the importance of reaching out to communities, educating them on health practices, and addressing healthcare disparities. Their leadership extends beyond hospital walls, significantly impacting public health.\n\nAn example in **nursing leadership** is Priya Reddy, a passionate advocate for women's health and a seasoned nurse leader. Priya's journey from the bedside to the boardroom reflects the changing dynamics of healthcare leadership. Her initiatives focus on providing quality care within hospital settings and empowering women to take charge of their health through awareness and education.\n\nThe role of **women in healthcare** leadership becomes even more pronounced in crises. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the resilience and leadership qualities of women in healthcare. Whether managing healthcare facilities, leading vaccination drives, or addressing public concerns, these leaders demonstrated the ability to navigate uncertainties and provide stability in the face of challenges.\n\nThe transformation brought about by **women in healthcare leadership** is not just about individual accomplishments; it's about building a sustainable and inclusive healthcare system. Their approach emphasises collaboration, innovation, and a patient-centred model that prioritises the well-being of communities.\n\nThe impact of nursing leadership led by women goes beyond the immediate healthcare setting; it has far-reaching effects on policy and systemic changes. Recognising the importance of their role, healthcare institutions are increasingly promoting gender diversity in leadership positions, ensuring that the decision-making process reflects a variety of perspectives.\n\nThe presence of **women in healthcare** leadership roles is shaping a more compassionate, holistic, and patient-centric **healthcare system** in India. As nursing leaders, women are not just contributing to the sector but redefining its essence. The future promises a healthcare landscape where the hearts and minds of these women continue to be at the forefront, ensuring the nation's well-being and laying the foundation for a healthier and more equitable India.At [Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly Fair & Lovely Career Foundation), we are dedicated to empowering women toward independence.

It is pretty much a task! Very risky and challenging.\n\nBut Kumkum has cleared that misunderstanding and has turned the tables. She has become India’s first woman loco pilot!\n\nBut this was not as easy as it sounds. Kumkum had to face challenges too. But she didn’t let it break her resolve.\n\n## ‘Trains’ her childhood fascination…\n\nWhile kids like Kumkum always dreamt of becoming a pilot, doctor, teacher, etc., young Kumkum dreamt of driving a train.\n\nA daughter becoming a loco pilot is not what all parents would have accepted, but Kumkum’s parents were different…\n\nHer father supported the decision that she had taken. And Kumkum did not disappoint him. She completed her B.com and, side by side, took a two-year electrical course from Industrial Training Institute(ITI).\n\nShe was so determined that she was completing her education and working on her passion simultaneously.\n\nITI was a gateway for her to appear for the [railway entrance exams](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/searchResult?searchKey=railway%20entrance%20exams.). She studied hard and applied for the Assistant Loco pilot post(ALP). Along with that, she completed her post-graduation in [social sciences.](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=social-science-and-research.)\n\nWhen she reached the exam centre, she saw that she was one of the seven women amongst thousands of male entrants.\n\nPeople were staring at her and the other six girls at the exam centre as if they didn’t belong to this profession. By seeing this, anyone would be nervous. But Kumkum did not let this nervousness impact her focus. She passed her exam successfully and was sent to Mumbai for further training.\n\nShe finally got her dream job at the Vasai lobby in Mumbai as the Assistant Loco Pilot on a goods train. She then, with her excellent skills, went on to become a Loco Pilot too! On 5th January 2021, an all-woman crew goods train drove from Vasai road to Vadodra.\n\nAlong with Kumkum, Udita Verma(assistant loco pilot), Akanksha Rai(Goods guard) were also a part of the crew. It’s so heart filling that women are breaking the glass ceilings and smashing stereotypes!\n\nBeing the first woman to lead a train, she was made fun of at the exam centre, and her colleagues too didn’t trust her and showed their male dominance.\n\nTime and again, Kumkum had to prove that she was worthy of this job. To prove her talent, she used to volunteer under challenging situations in the train journeys. She also had to get down from the train in the middle of the night to check the tires when it had halted in a jungle.\n\n### But she did not let such challenges scare her.\n\nThis is not the end!\n\nKumkum is not going to settle on just being a loco pilot of a goods train. She dreams of driving high-speed trains like Rajdhani Express, Duranto, etc. She also wants to train other girls who aspire to become loco pilots. Inspired by Kumkum’s journey, there are now 33-woman assistant loco pilots in training in the Mumbai region alone.\n\nIf you want to shine like Kumkum and do something extraordinary for your future, Glow and Lovely Careers have many options!

You might get a lot of suggestions from a lot of people and it can mean even more chaos. Sometimes your friends can suggest things that you might like in the first instance, but once you explore that option, you realize, it isn’t as suitable for you as it might have seemed. If you can relate to that sense of confusion and stress about your future as a contributing woman in society, you should take inspiration from the story of B.Com student Pragya Rai.\n\nPragya Rai hails from the city of Varanasi. As a college student, she decided to play it safe and seek a course that would enable her to have multiple options when it came to career opportunities. “I thought the whole reason to take B.Com was to see what interested me in college. Taking a generic course would allow me to understand what options I had for my future career and figure out what it is exactly that I might be good at.”\n\nIn her conversation with friends, she realized there was a lot of different information about career opportunities. It was confusing and sometimes she realized that there was a lot of unintentional misinformation too. She had felt that it was a repeat of the same experience she had had in high school as well. Pragya says, “When I was in high school I was very confused if the things I wanted to do would be right for me. It is very difficult to get career counseling or, say, good guidance, for free in my city.”\n\nLuckily for Pragya, she decided to take the search for help online. She looked for free online career counseling options and even free career tests online. Eventually, she stumbled on to the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) career test online.\n\n“The test was free, quick and easy to take.”, says Pragya.\n\nEven while she was struggling with coming to a firm decision about her future career, Pragya knew that she wanted to make a difference. Her determination might not have had a concrete direction, but she had a gut instinct about her ambitions. Her free online career guidance test results showed her the right course of action. “The results reassured me that civil services would be the right career for me. It gave me the much-needed confidence to pursue my dream.” With the clarity that was previously missing, Pragya is now busy in college, completing her B.Com course on one hand and preparing wholeheartedly for a career in civil services on the other.\n\nPragya’s story shows us the power of curiosity. As a young woman in the world, it is important to explore. It helps you better understand what you actually want to do. It also helps you explore opportunities that you might be unaware of. In Pragya’s instance, she took a chance and searched for career guidance online and it led her to discover Glow and Lovely Careers’ (formerly known as Fair and Lovely Career Foundation) [interest-based test and ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance)[psychometric test for career planning](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance).

While male:female population ratio is a significant reason for this, the lack of equal work opportunity comes in at a close second. The private sector is still struggling to fill this gap. However, the Indian government jobs are improving on this front. Quickly. They offer better benefits, fixed hours, excellent job stability, extra holidays and pensions. The salaries after are at par with the private sector, all thanks to the 7th pay commission.\n\n## The top 5 government jobs for women and not necessarily hired in the order of preference are:\n\n1. Banking Jobs: Bank PO and clerk jobs are the most sought after positions. They are considered the most prestigious as well for women. Female employees can take transfers closer to home thanks to the new transfer laws. One needs to take SBI PO, IBPS PO, or RRB PO tests for qualifying. The average basic monthly pay for PO starts at roughly ₹23,000.\n2. Railways' Jobs: Various jobs in the Indian Railways are highly preferred by females. Indian Railways offer attractive salaries, housing facilities, travelling perks, retirement benefits, bonuses, and some of the best maternity benefits. Their policies are also transfer-friendly for women. Depending upon a technical or a non-technical preference, one can opt for a respective RRB annual entrance exam. Salaries depend upon years of experience and job type.\n3. Government Teacher/Assistant professor: What can be more prestigious than the job to mould the country's future? Whatsmore you get to enjoy almost all public holidays, and long vacations too. To become a teacher, you must clear the TET exams by the government. The average salary paid by some state governments is about ₹2.5L per year.\n4. Jobs by Staff Selection Commission: Ladies with only 10+2 academic backgrounds can find respectable jobs like Postal Assistant, Data-entry operator, Sorting Operator, Lower Divisional Clerk, etc. To qualify, candidates must clear the SSC HCGL annual test hosted by the State Staff Selection Board. Suppose you are worried about getting paid less. In that case, you should know that the salary of a postal assistant is roughly ₹2.35L - ₹7.30L per year.\n5. PSU: When the Central or the State government holds at least a 51% stake in a company, such a company falls under PSU, a.k.a Public Sector Undertaking. These jobs are technically government jobs too. PSU jobs are typically classified into levels of Group A, B, and C. Opportunities in PSU are wide-ranging, from managers to Company Secretary, head officers to clerks. The salaries here too vary depending on the post and no. of years of experience.\n\nSeveral women prefer medical, defence, police recruitments, and various civil services too. However, due to transfer and placement policies, or physical activity required, these job sectors tend to be among the lower chosen options for females in general.\n\nWhile these are the top government jobs, they come with certain unfavourable conditions. One of the biggest reasons is transfer to remote, unfriendly or significantly underdeveloped areas. Another leading factor to consider is monotony in work. The daily grind can get a little boring with minimal scope of creativity. So a take a decision wisely.

The number of institutes that offered these courses was even lesser. But thanks to technology, faster internet speeds and overall development in the educational space, things are very different today. With every passing day, students are getting more and more options for highly specialised courses. Earning a good living today is far easier than before, thanks to the availability of various interest-based academic courses.\n\nOne of the most significant modern debates is whether or not a university degree is as necessary as it used to be. Please note that this article in no way negates the importance of a formal degree. Still, a diploma does have various pros that one should be aware of.\n\n## Benefits of a diploma\n\n1. Diploma programs are generally shorter than their respective degree course.\n2. Online diplomas don't require you to physically attend a class in an institute.\n3. Diplomas are far cheaper than an actual degree course.\n4. Diplomas are perfect for those students who do not want to commit to a field but simply want to explore the possibility of pursuing an area of their current interest.\n5. A diploma is usually very, very field-specific. This specialisation offers the students to learn skills for the same job they are looking for instead of learning about that field in general.\n6. Since diplomas are quicker to finish, they help you get started with pay hikes relatively faster.\n7. Getting into a diploma program is relatively more straightforward.\n8. Since many diplomas are online, one can get a diploma certificate from a university of choice abroad, at a fraction of the cost, without ever leaving India.\n\n### Things to keep in mind before opting for a diploma\n\n1. Not all online courses are diplomas. Due diligence before enrolling for a class or a program is crucial.\n2. A diploma program that offers a certificate should be your ideal choice.\n3. Not all diploma programs are associated with a university. Some fields may require a university accredited diploma certificate.\n4. Online learning demands discipline and self-motivation.\n\n### Five online diploma courses\n\nYou can do these diplomas from the comfort of your home to jumpstart your career. These courses can help you get a pay rise if you already work.\n\n1. **Digital Content Marketing Diploma:** This course teaches the basics of digital content marketing while giving you a sense of production for video, photos, blogs and other digital content types. upGrad offers a reasonable starter course for those looking to get a feel of the field.\n2. **Designing for Fashion Diploma: ** Toronto Film School Canada offers this course.

A common requirement in almost every career is decent speaking and writing. That's right - good communication skills can land you a good job and may just give you an advantage over other applicants. This is where taking an online creative writing course comes in handy. Are you surprised? Well, here's a secret, the skills learnt through a creative writing course can help you even if you aren't a writer. Not just in terms of improved communication, but many more. And what's better - you can attend the course in the comfort of your house, away from the pandemic troubles. Want to know how? Read on to understand why this course is an essential part of everyone's journey - writer or not:\n\n1. Let's start with career options. A creative writing course covers various types of writing, including genre-specific, fiction, non-fiction, journalism, article writing, copywriting and more. Aside from these, fields such as web content development, teaching, editing and proofreading, social media management, media houses, etc., require competent writing skills. This will increase the scope of work and career options significantly.\n2. The main aim of a creative writing course, simply put, is to improve the quality of writing. The first step is to learn to take inspiration from the world around you and find the topic you wish to write about. The course will help hone your thinking and observation skills while also helping you outline what you want to say to make it enjoyable to the receiver. This practice will help you understand your audience, teach you how to best respond to concerns, develop innovative ideas and solutions, and provide unique perspectives. As a whole, this will prepare you how to decide and create a superior writeup.\n3. To convey your story to your audience without misunderstanding, you need to communicate well. Communication is another field that any writing course covers. Not only does this help you write down your thoughts better and help your audience understand you, but it also helps you improve your day-to-day communication skills. Whether you are talking to your boss, colleagues, or friends, you will find it easier to speak freely and confidently. And because almost every field requires written communication skills, your boss is sure to be impressed with your writing applications, emails and more.\n4. In the duration of a creative writing course, you will find your voice - your unique writing style. Your voice, combined with the basics of literature, including lyricism, poetic license, various genres, and formats, will form the writing that will connect you with your audience. This voice belongs to you, and others will find it difficult to copy, making you irreplaceable to your audience, who have already formed a bond with you.\n5. A creative writing course helps you with prompts and topics. An instructor will be available to guide you with constructive criticism to help you write better. It increases your writing frequency and creates a habit of daily writing. The more you write, the better you write, and the better you write, the more the audience wants to read it!\n\nIf you're unsure which career is best for you, you can look at career options that require creative writing at [The Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Career Guidance, Career Development, Career Planning, Career Options, Online Career Test\n\n",

Public administration is the application of government policies. So, a public administrator is a public servant who works in a public department or agency. These departments exist across all levels of government.\n\nIn India, public administration plays a very important role in the functioning of the country. It is the default tool for governance in the country. It also is the way we ensure the social and cultural development of the country.\n\nBefore the independence of India, ICS (Indian Civil Services) posts were held only by men. In 1972 gender equality was introduced in public administration but the number of women in administration has not been a fair representation of the educated and qualified women in the country. Studies point to three key reasons for the underrepresentation of women in administration - personal factors, organizational factors, and cultural factors. While more jobs in public administration have increased the possibility of more women in the administrative workforce, women enjoy only 12 percent representation in the country’s administration.\n\nIn recent years the trend has shifted as more women are becoming part of public administration. The shift in society’s thinking towards working women has been a major factor. Additional government support and benefits for women in public administration have resulted in a lot of women achievers in the field we admire. Women like Ira Singhal (Indian Revenue Service), Dr. Ruveda Salam (Assistant Commissioner of Police), and Kiran Bedi (India’s first Indian Administrative Services officer) are inspirational figures who have set a path to follow.\n\nTo pursue a career in public administration, you must first find courses on an administration that can help you prepare for common entrance tests. Since it’s a very competitive field, you will need to be properly prepared to achieve your goal. An easy first step would be to take an introductory course online, like the free Introduction to Public Administration course (click [here](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/niit-1999/introduction-to-public-administration)) offered by the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).\n\nThe benefit of taking up this course is that not only is it free, it is also very simple to understand and takes you through the basics of public administration so you are completely clear about the nature and scope of public administration. This course will not only set you up with a solid foundation for the entrance exams, but it will also prepare you mentally for the tough preparation you need to make for the exams, and ultimately achieving your dreams.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Public Admin and Government, IAS Officer, Women in Public Administration, Civil Services, Online Courses\n\n",

Taking online tests will help you learn and master these shortcuts and improve your understanding of the mathematical calculations.\n\nAdditionally, you will also know your strengths and weaknesses. You may have mastered some advanced techniques, but your basics may need revision. The only way to assess your abilities is through a mock test. Your answer pattern and score will help you identify the areas you need to work on and spend more time practicing.\n\nIf you pass the necessary entrance exams, you will have to go through group discussions and personal interview rounds. These two rounds will be the deciding factor in your selection. So, prepare for these rounds as well. In these rounds, you will be questioned on banking sector policies, the economy and general knowledge. To do well in these sections, you must stay updated. Read the newspaper daily. Subscribe and follow financial blogs.\n\nFinally, do not take unnecessary stress as it will negatively affect your performance.

This one month should be utilized by you only to brush up on the topics you have already studied and to keep practicing questions on them.\n\n2.Practice question papers from at least the last 10 years. These will give you a very good idea of the kind of questions that you can expect and hence, you will be able to plan your study and practice accordingly.\n\n3.

However, you will have access to a virtual calculator on the screen of your computer. So, make sure you practice all calculations using the virtual calculator during your preparation.\n\n6. Do not ignore the General Aptitude and Engineering Mathematics portions during your preparation. These are not the technical parts, but they carry 30% of the total GATE marks. Do find time to solve questions under these sections too.\n\n7. Develop a proper strategy to implement while answering during the actual exam as well. Do a quick scan of the questions once and answer those that you are very sure of. In the second round, answer questions that you can in less than 2 minutes.

The answer to that question is undoubtedly very, very tricky. One lady's dream job can be another woman's nightmare. The ideal job should take care of all your personal goals so that you do not experience burnout and will be able to grow your career in the field you choose.\n\n## What is an Ideal Job or a Dream Job?\n\nThere is no one field, sector or industry with a universally desired dream job. However, before taking up any government sector or a private company job, you should know some of the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\n### Hiring\n\nTo qualify for government jobs, you have to go through tedious and highly competitive national level exams. Hiring for government jobs is slow too. However, it is easier to get a job in a private company. You may even get the same job role at various companies, so choose the best one that suits you. Hiring is pretty quick too, which means you can start earning quickly and almost instantly.\n\n### Salary\n\nPrivate jobs pay high salaries with the possibility of more significant hikes as well. Government jobs pay well too but not as good as their counterparts for sure. Plus, salary increments are left on the Pay Commissions' decisions. Which means you may be stuck on the same income for an unexpected time.\n\n### Perks\n\nThe health benefits are definitely better in private jobs, but the post-retirement benefits are better in government jobs. Companies give mostly HRA while many government jobs provide housing. The undoubted best perk for young women is maternity leaves in government jobs (6 months vs 3 months provided by any private company). What's more, in railways, an adopting mother can even stretch this to 2 years.\n\n### Job stability\n\nPrivate job hiring and layoffs depend upon the current requirements of the company and its financial health. Pharma, IT, FMCG, etc., are all known for mass firing. In contrast, government jobs are definitely more stable and provide job security. They are unaffected by the market conditions. The COVID-19 virus pandemic is a case in point. The government did not cut salaries or fire people like private sector bosses did.\n\n### Growth\n\nCareer growth options are better for private company employees. Personal initiatives are appreciated, and promotions are easier to come by for driven individuals. Government jobs are often monotonous as they lack room for creativity. There is also a minimal appreciation of personal initiatives. Due to bureaucracy, disappointment is readily available, while a promotion is hard to come by in a government job.\n\n### Work-life balance\n\nGovernment jobs offer the best work-life balance due to fixed working hours. More often than not, private jobs may demand work on holidays/weekends without sufficient additional compensation. Plus, government jobs offer more holidays which means you can spend more time with your family.\n\nHowever, the overall work culture is better in private companies. Punctuality is demanded and appreciated as well. Offices are usually better, well equipped, and often look better than 5-star hotels. Government jobs are known for lazy, laid back attitudes, bureaucracy and poor working environments.**Hope this helps you make the right decision.

She started her unique clothing line – Nayshaas. And also ended up helping underprivileged women earn during the pandemic!\n\nBorn in Chandigarh, Gurmeen decided to take up a course in fashion designing. Despite having a fashion designing background, she never thought of directly starting her own business.\n\nIn fact, after finishing her degree in designing, Gurmeet took up job a corporate job. Soon she became a senior manager at an export firm in Mumbai.\n\nThen she got married and decided to take a break from work.

It can be the [start of a new opportunity](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-tests) waiting to happen.\n\n## Birth of a woman entrepreneur\n\nPost-delivery, just like most mothers, Gurmeen couldn’t fit into her clothes before pregnancy. So she wanted to create something that women could wear irrespective of their physical structure. With this idea in mind, Gurmeen started her own clothing line.\n\nSince her daughter’s birth was the reason behind this start up, she named venture after her daughter, Nayshaa.

But rather than a complaint about it, she used it as a learning experience to start her own company of herbal cosmetics\n\nVibha was a teenager when she started suffering from severe PCOD. This resulted in severe hair fall and acne as well as irregular periods. She visited many doctors and underwent many treatments. But nothing worked.\n\nWorried about her daughter’s health, her mother started mixing ayurvedic powders like Ashwagandha and Shatavari in her food. Within a few months, Vibha could feel the difference in her health.\n\nOver a period of time, her hair-fall reduced, and periods regularised. This experience left Vibha impressed with the power of herbal products and Ayurveda.\n\n**As ayurvedic medicines helped her cure her condition, she thought of formulating ayurvedic products and selling them.**\n\nDriven by her thought of starting something of her own, Vibha left her corporate job. This was her first step to success.\n\nThe next step was getting to know the field in depth.\n\nSo she started interacting with herbal practitioners from different parts of the world. From the USA to Singapore, she spoke with everyone and gained tremendous knowledge about this field.\n\nAlong with that, she took guidance from her mother.\n\nVibha was so determined that she took a course on Herbalism too. Then she visited different farms in Karnataka to formulate her own herbal products.\n\nWith sufficient knowledge and information, Vibha Harish launched her own herbal nutrition and plant-based supplement company. She called it Cosmix.\n\nThe main goal of Cosmix was to make products to improve health and immunity in women.\n\n**Within one year, Cosmix registered a turnover of around Rs 2 crore!**\n\nJust when it seemed that everything was going well, the Covid Pandemic hit.\n\nDuring this Pandemic, Vibha’s business came to hold. Due to the safety reasons of her employees, she gave her business a short break.\n\nBut she did not stop her work during that period. She noticed that children between three to six years of age are not getting proper nutrition.\n\n“Earlier, these children, living in rural areas of Karnataka, were part of mid-day meal schemes which ensured daily nutrition. However, once schools were shut, they were unable to eat nutritious food. Some of them were even malnourished,” she said.\n\nThat’s when Vibha decided to start the programme - Nutrition for All. Through this programme, food and energy bars are given to malnourished children in rural India.\n\nLast checked, around 2,50,000 bars were distributed to 1400 children. Vibha used part of the company’s profits to fund the \"Nutrition for All\" programme\n\nVibha’s ambition and her desire to do something different is really an inspiration to girls today.\n\nJust like Vibha, there are also so many young girls who are thinking out of the box and doing different things.\n\nIf you are one of them, Glow and Lovely Careers has multiple options for you to check out.

In addition to being a great practice to relax your mind and body, it is also an exercise. It is practised not just in India but also worldwide. Hence it is no surprise that the demand for Yoga teachers is high.\n\n## Are you looking to make a career teaching yoga? Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Learn in a YCB accredited yoga training centre:**\n\nTo teach Yoga, you first need to be well-versed in the practice. Look up centres that have been accredited by the Yoga Certification Board. YCB is the government body that provides certification for yoga professionals.\n\nYou can also choose to get trained personally by a Yoga instructor. Ensure you choose one who is YCB-certified.\n\n1. **Get trained:**\n\nAt a YCB-accredited centre, you can choose two paths. The first one is a Yoga Therapist. The second is the Yoga Education Category. We will focus on the latter. In the Yoga Education Category, there are different courses for five different levels of certification:\n\n- **Yoga Volunteer: **Anyone under the age of 75 can apply for this basic certification. You will get certified once you undergo 36 hours of training and work as an assistant in yoga group classes or take charge of yoga breaks at workplaces.\n- **Yoga Protocol Instructor: **You can apply for this level if you've passed your 10th. To get certified, you must complete 200 hours of training in one to three months.\n- **Yoga Wellness Instructor: **Ideal for those who want to do yoga to stay healthy and prevent diseases.

To get certified, you will need to complete 400 hours of training.\n- **Yoga Teacher & Evaluator: **Candidates with a bachelor's degree in any stream from a recognised university can apply to this course. It requires 800 hours of training over nine to fifteen months.\n- **Yoga Master: **Graduates of any stream can apply for this course. It requires you to complete a minimum of 1600 hours of training.\n\nSome YCB accredited institutes are not particular about educational qualifications. You can check with the institutes beforehand.\n\n1. **Get certified by the YCB:**\n\nEach of the certifications mentioned above requires candidates to sit for exams. The yoga volunteer exam is entirely theoretical. The other four exams are a mix of theory and practical.\n\n1. **Start working:**\n\nAfter passing the exam, you will be awarded your certificate and identity card. You can then start working at your level. You can opt to work at yoga colleges, hospitals or any institution. You can even teach at a YCB-accredited centre.\n\n1. **Maintain your certification:**\n\nAll levels of certification have a 5-year validity from the date of result declaration by YCB. You can renew your certificate with the help of CYE or Continuing Yoga Education. Renewing your certification involves the following:\n\n- a performance assessment during the period of certification\n- an orientation programme to strengthen your skill as a yoga professional\n\nThe CYE programme (CYEP) lasts for about two to three days. You can choose one of the two versions of the programme:\n\n- attending a CYEP at a leading yoga institution\n- Submitting a virtual report on students who you trained along with other supporting documents before appearing for an exam in front of the committee\n\nOnce you complete your first CYEP, the committee decides whether to award you a lifelong certification or ask you to attend the following CYEP.\n\nIn India, the salary of a Yoga Teacher ranges from ₹ 0.3 Lakhs to ₹ 7.8 Lakhs, with an average annual wage of ₹ 3.0 Lakhs.\n\nCheck if this is the career for you with the[ Career Guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) test at Glow & Lovely Careers (formally known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Career Guidance, Free career guidance, Career Planning, Career Options, Yoga Instructor In India, Yoga teachers\n\n",

In India, [RBI](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/online-tests/Testbook/5796d79e9389865c92bf0806), [Railways](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/online-tests/Testbook/569c9730995a2d097081cf8a), [State Bank](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/online-tests/Testbook/568a751185111b4193101100) all conduct online aptitude tests to fill vacancies\n- They are affordable - online tests are cheaper than coaching institutes, many of them are free too\n- They offer flexibility - you can give your online tests anytime and from anywhere\n- They give you instant feedback on your performance - Most online tests offered today to give you instant feedback on your own performance\n- They allow comparative performance analysis - Many online tests allow you to instantly compare your performance with other students or job-seekers preparing for the same test. This helps you assess where you stand and your chances of making it.\n\nWhen preparing for your aptitude exam, sitting through [online mock tests](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/online-tests/Testbook) can help you fix a lot of things that might be a hurdle for you. Let’s see how:\n\n### Get Familiar with the Instructions\n\nEvery aptitude test has a set of instructions with important guidelines like- time allotted for each test, the total number of questions in a section, total marks associated with the test, how to answer the questions, etc. When you sit through a mock test online, you can get a good idea about commonly stated instructions so that during the actual aptitude test, you can save time. A word of caution, always read instructions at the start of every test since they may differ according to different organizations.\n\n### Know What Kind of Questions you May Encounter\n\nThere are various categories of aptitude exams including spatial reasoning, numerical reasoning, situational judgment, etc., containing different types of questions. Online mock tests are designed in a way so that you get maximum exposure to various questions. These will be very similar to what you may encounter in your final test, although you should always bear in mind that they won't be exactly the same.\n\n### Practice Time Management\n\nIn any aptitude test, time plays an important role. Even if you are an expert and capable of answering all the questions, it is very important that you stick to the given time duration. If you are not able to answer all questions within the stipulated time, it will negatively impact your overall score. Once you start practicing with online tests, your speed of answering automatically improves.\n\n### Study your Results\n\nAfter submitting the test, you will have results in front of you. They will reveal your scores based on your answers and you will be able to see where you went wrong. Studying your mock test results can help you improve your performance as you learn the right answers to questions you got wrong. You can then focus on practicing sections where you tend to make more mistakes to further boost your confidence before the actual test.\n\n### Improve your accuracy and consistency\n\nWhen you do a lot of practice online, your ability to get answers right every time you give a test should improve. Like a professional singer who rehearses before a performance, the benefit of a lot of practice is that you will be ready to give a good performance in your aptitude test even while giving it unfamiliar circumstances like an exam hall or testing center.\n\nThese are the five ways in which online tests can help you prepare for an aptitude exam.

The question on everyone's minds is what this virus does to the body. Covid-19 typically affects the respiratory system and causes symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath. The virus works by getting inside the cells your body and then hijacks them.\n\nOne of the critical things to bear in mind with this virus is that at an early stage, you may not get sick and that some people do not even detect symptoms. The time between infection and first symptoms appearing varies, but typically it's five to seven days on average. According to the World Health Organisation, common symptoms include fever, tiredness, a dry cough, shortness of breath, body aches, sore throat, and very few people will report diarrhea, nausea, or a runny nose.\n\nWhen the virus enters your system, usually beginning in the back of the throat, they multiply infecting the neighboring cells. Once it reaches and damages the lungs, it becomes difficult for the lungs to perform their main functions and supply oxygen to the blood that travels throughout the body. The virus multiplies in the respiratory tract and can cause a range of symptoms, according to Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. \"You have mild cases, which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms, sore throat, runny nose, fever, all the way through pneumonia. There can be varying levels of severity of pneumonia all the way through multi-organ failure and death,\" she told reporters in Geneva on February 7 according to a report on Aljazeera.\n\nIt is important to do whatever is possible to prevent this virus from entering your bodies. WHO has provided a list of guidelines to be followed, and even though they may seem basic, it is very important to follow them. These include washing your hands with water and soap or using an alcohol-based hand rub, avoid touching your face with your hands, covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough, and maintaining social distancing.\n\nWhile everyone isn't an expert and can only follow the advice given, we do have some of you interested in a career in health and who want to know more about how the human body works. The course on Essential Human Biology: Cells and Tissues provides a foundation in human anatomy and physiology. The course gives you an understanding of the relationships between typical structure and the function in human cells and tissues. What's more, it employs several engaging learning methods, including videos, animations, interactive activities, and quizzes to help guide you through key concepts and helps make learning relevant. So, if you do decide to take this course, you'll get knowledge of the structure and function of human cells and tissues. You'll understand basic human anatomy and physiology and you will be able to prepare yourself for a career in health.\n\n*Link*: [https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/edx-adelaidex+humbio101x/essential-human-biology:-cells-and-tissues](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/en/course-detail/edx-adelaidex+humbio101x/essential-human-biology:-cells-and-tissues)\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Healthcare, Covid 19, Coronavirus, Science and Research\n\n",

It can bring a significant upturn to her life and her family and this will automatically affect her mental state very positively. Financial independence is one of the most important factors that affect the quality and of one’s life and equally so for women.\n\nIn India, with more women entering higher education every year, we now have 27% women who are enrolled in tertiary education. This is a great achievement, and in many disciplines in universities, we have women outnumbering men in the class. Although this is a refreshing development, the number of women involved in the labour force in India still requires a lot more progress. Despite educational gains, as of 2017, we have only 28.5% women participating in the labour force in India. At Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation), we strive every day to make the women our country aware of the importance of being financially independent and self-sufficient. As a part of this endeavour, we are launching the First Salary campaign at the Glow & Lovely Careers in order to inspire and encourage the women of our country to become independent.\n\n![Woman's first salary](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/456.png) *[1500x860]*If you are one of those women who hasn't started working and earning money yet, then these are a few things that will help you understand how your first salary, or Pehli Tankhwa, can change your life for the better:\n\n### 1. You become financially independent\n\nMaking your own hard-earned money is the most liberating feeling in the world. This financial freedom can instantly help boost your confidence and help you realize your self-worth. The ability to spend money made from your hard work will make you feel mentally peaceful and happy.\n\n### 2. You are better respected in society and family\n\nWith the arrival of a woman’s Pehli Tankhwa, the entire family and society start looking at her in a different light. There’s far more respect when you bring in the money needed to run the house. Although it is not always true that money and respect go hand-in-hand, in most cases if you make hard earned money you do get to enjoy a different state of respect.\n\n### 3. You have better control over life\n\nEarning your first salary brings a lot of mental control and peace. Knowing that you have a better grip on your life and financial status makes you feel much more confident.\n\n### 4. You learn life skills\n\nTravelling on a daily basis to your workplace, meeting new people every day, handling different kinds of things, confronting new challenges- a combination of all these things, make you a better person and a stronger individual every day.\n\n### 5. Your family prospers\n\nEvery individual who is at the right age and has the capability to work should do it. Your family will become financially stronger and benefit from your earnings. Research shows that women are more likely to invest their earning into their family's health and education than men are.\n\n### 6. You feel empowered\n\nWomen's empowerment is something that has been discussed at length for quite some time now. At Glow & Lovely Careers, we strive to attain exactly that for the women in our country. A woman’s first salary makes her feel empowered and strong and should, ideally, give her the courage she needs to stay committed to working and earning.\n\nGlow & Lovely Careers has a number of [free online courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) and [career guidance tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) that will help enable the women of India to equip and prepare themselves for careers.

However, it is not the only thing that matters. You probably have the right qualifications and experience, but chances are, if you don't manage to impress the interviewer with your soft skills, you won't get the job.\n\nThink of it this way. Many candidates are applying for the same job. Almost all of them have approximately the same level of skills. So, while your skillset might get you through the door to an interview, your soft skills will decide whether you get the role or not. It could give you the upper edge over other applicants.\n\nSoft skills are highly in demand. This is because they help you work better and more closely with clients and other departments.\n\n## Here are four soft skills you should focus on developing to help you get a job:\n\n1. **Be enthusiastic and show it!**\n\nThat's right - any employer would prefer an employee who actually wants to work in the company. Do not look bored or uninterested in the job. Don't be afraid to show your passion. You may not appeal to the interviewer if you seem to be there to improve their career or salary.\n\nShow your keenness by arriving early, asking questions and showing the right attitude.\n\nUnderstand the company's culture and state how you would be a good fit. Show the interviewer you are dependable and can adapt well.\n\n1. **Communicate well.**\n\nCommunication is crucial. It doesn't only mean having a good command of the language. It means being able to get your points across well. It means understanding what is asked of you and being able to answer. A good communicator is also an avid listener. Diplomacy, clarity and confidence are three crucial points. Every company looks for someone who is not only good at their jobs but can work well with others as a team.\n\nA good idea would be to pre-prepare answers to commonly asked questions. This will help you answer better.\n\n1. **Talk about your Problem Solving Skills**\n\nBefore you walk into an interview, list down situations of how you tackled a problem. Show the interviewer you are an ideal candidate because of how well you deal with any issue. The examples must highlight your approach to the problems. Talk about a situation where you solved a problem independently as well as with your team. Also, mention how your decision impacted the situation. An applicant who can easily overcome a problem using innovative or critical thinking will definitely impress.\n\n1. **Show off your Leadership or Management skills. **\n\nAn ideal candidate will contribute to meetings, build good business relationships and take the initiative. It is essential to emphasise your ability to work as a team. Proving that you have an inclusive approach and are responsible will help. Having the right soft skills, technical skills, and experience together will make you an ideal candidate. Do you want to know more about what soft skills you can use and how to use them?

However, we still have a long way to go. Research shows that having more women in the workforce will improve the country’s economy considerably. Although we have 43% of the total working women in regular wage and salaried positions by the year 2011-2012 (which is an increase from the 28.5% that existed in 1993-1994), we have still need to achieve a lot in terms of including more and more women into the workforce of India. The Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) encourages more & more women to come forward and utilize their potential to become self-sufficient by providing them [free online courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses), [career guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance), online mock tests and more.\n\n## Here are a few ways by which women’s workforce participation in our country can be improved:\n\n### Support from family\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that girls face with respect to getting higher education and going to work is the lack of support from family. Girls were most often married off very early and stopped from achieving the kind of education or profession they wanted. With the changing times, the mindset of Indian families is also changing and their support can make a huge difference.\n\n### Government schemes\n\nThe Indian government has devised numerous plans to achieve better workforce participation from women. Various schemes like STEP (Support to Training and Employment Programme for Women), MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), MUDRA, etc have been made to support women who wish to work.\n\n![How to improve women's workforce participation](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/shutterstock_665835889%20%282%29_0.jpg) *[2688x1792]*### Access to education\n\nThere are many girls in our country who do not get the opportunity to work owing to a lack of proper education. To make quality education more accessible many entities like the Glow & Lovely Careers provide online courses for free that interested women can take. The foundation also provides online certification courses in numerous subjects which can help them enter the profession they like.\n\n### Working women hostels\n\nFor those women staying away from homes for work, the government has come up with this scheme to promote the availability of safe and conveniently located accommodation for the working women. The accommodation will include daycare facilities for the children of these working women in the urban, semi-urban and even rural areas. Aspiring women professionals should make use of this.\n\n### Corporates supporting women\n\nCorporate companies must alter their policies to enable more women to join the workplace. There are many women who leave their jobs at corporate companies due to certain unfavourable conditions. Although companies like Adobe, IndiGo, etc have made commendable changes, more of them should join.\n\nBetter support from the society will help more women make the right career choices and explore more [career options](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Career Guidance, Career Development\n\n",

This gives them relevant workplace experience and they will be valued more by recruiters compared to the others. Apart from this, the [career guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) they get during their internship will help them decide the career path that they would like to choose in the future. Another important reason why internships are great for a career boost is that the competition among graduates and job-seekers for jobs is increasing by the day. In this scenario, recruiters will always prefer those who already have practical work experience and industry knowledge.\n\nAn internship could be either paid or voluntary, and this could last anywhere between 10- 12 weeks. To get better insights into how an internship can help you as an aspiring professional, we spoke to Simran Malik, an intern working in the digital marketing team of Capillary Technologies. The company works for scores of clients and each from a different industry type. She finds the work quite challenging and exciting at the same time. Here are a few pointers we understood to be benefits of internships after talking to her:\n\n**Real World Experience**\n\nWhen inquired about what Simran has learned from the real world experience she got at her workplace, she said that she was excited to understand practical applications of all the digital marketing theories she studied in college. Simran got a detailed and practical understanding of how digital marketing works and how differently it functions for different industries.\n\nIn addition to studying the basics of digital marketing as part of her MBA course, she also did short [online courses ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses)to further her knowledge before starting her internship. She says that it was a great experience to witness first-hand all the knowledge that she gained through various sources getting converted into real work experiences. This helped her to develop more interest in the subject and motivated her to explore more.\n\n**Explore a career path**\n\nExploring is an important part of the college experience, and internships are a great way for students to acquaint themselves with the field they are interested in. When asked Simran about this, she said that doing this internship reinforced her interest in digital marketing and she intends to continue working in the same field. Often students join college with a certain career path in mind, and end up changing their minds later on. Taking an internship helps students to understand what actually interests them.**Improve your resume**\n\nEmployers always want potential candidates to bring a good set of skills to the table. And, it is your resume that will speak about the skills you have. The stronger your resume, the higher will be your chances to be called for an interview. The skills you learned during your internship will surely make you stand out from the rest of the crowd. Employers are much more likely to hire someone who has an internship experience over someone who has a generic resume.\n\n**Interact and network with professionals**\n\nIn the professional world, networking plays a very important role. We asked Simran about the things she learned during the internship and one of the most notable things she said was that she learnt how to interact professionally with people.

They cannot miss out on many lectures at school or fall behind in the syllabus completion.\n\nMoreover, the school or tuitions always plan the entire teaching process only to ultimately aim at the syllabus completion before the commencement of the board examination.\n\nOnline courses can save you in such situations.\n\nEven if a lesson or an essential portion of the syllabus is missed out, one can revise, learn and get additional tips and tricks that can be used during exams through online courses. This helps you develop your study routine at your convenience.\n\n**Proper revisions and preparation level checks: ** Online courses often provide factual information that is sometimes out of the syllabus.\n\nThis increases your knowledge, and you can further relate well to the content of the syllabus.\n\nApart from that, these courses have minor revisions or mock tests after every session. This ensures that you understand and sink in the entire lesson accurately and clarifies where you need to practice more and where you are well prepared.\n\n**No travel required:**** **Online courses provide flexibility. You can study from anywhere and at any time. For many students doing internships or a part-time job, online classes can save them from any backlog caused due to the constantly changing routine.\n\nOnline courses save time and energy that is much more needed during the preparations of competitive entrance exams and board exams.\n\nOnline courses can help any candidate score well in the most challenging examinations.

Read the question paper well\n\nThe first and foremost thing is to read the question paper thoroughly. This helps you not to skip any questions while writing the essay. Checking for the marks assigned to each question is very important. This helps in writing the answer comprehensively. Generally, 15 mins are given by the board to read the question paper. This much time is enough to read and mark the questions as easy, moderate and strenuous. Keeping in this way helps decide which question should be attempted at first.\n\n#### 2. Don't panic about the tough questions.\n\nNaturally, you begin to worry and get scared about a tricky question. The fact is that once you start working on them, they get easier. But tough questions always takes some time to get solved. So at first, it is always better to begin attempting the easier one.\n\n#### 3. Ensure speed and accuracy\n\nUse quicker methods to solve the questions, especially in mathematics exams. Mock tests are the best solution for such cases. They are solving plenty of mock tests before the final exams can help time management. Speed and accuracy are the most critical factors in board exams. This is why use more straightforward calculation methods while solving an equation or word problems.\n\n#### 4. Avoid overthinking about a question\n\nAllocate your time to the questions as per the marks assigned to them. Writing unnecessary lengthy answers will merely waste your time.\n\n#### 5. Revise before you submit the paper\n\nRevise all your answers well before submitting your paper. This will save you from silly mistakes and make your time for corrections.\n\n#### 6. Be neat and clean\n\nIn the board exams, generally, handwriting matters a lot. Everyone does not have good writing but writes so every for constructive that it is understandable and readable to the examiner.\n\n### Competitive Exams Conducted by the CBSE\n\nThe union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi cleared a proposal to create a National Test Agency (NTA) that will work as an autonomous body for conducting the entrance exams in India.\n\nIn 2018, various exams previously conducted by CBSE were then transferred to NTA. Including JEE(Joint Entrance Exam), NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)\n\n#### Currently, CBSE conducts Central Teachers Eligibility Test (CTET) exams.\n\nCTET exams are conducted twice a year to determine the eligibility of candidates for appointment as teachers for classes 1-8.\n\nThere are two papers conducted in a year. Paper I is for the candidates who wish to be appointed as primary teachers (i.e-from class1-6), and paper II is for those who want to be appointed as the secondary teacher (i.e- from class 7-10).\n\nThose who wish to teach from classes 1-10 can appear for both papers.\n\n#### ●     CTET Eligibility\n\nThe candidate should be a 12th pass with an aggregate of 45% to be eligible for the CTET exams for appointment as a primary teacher.\n\nFor the appointment as the elementary level teacher, a candidate should be graduated with a minimum of 50% aggregate or a 12th pass with at least 45% aggregate.\n\nAlong with that, the candidate should complete the teacher’s training program.\n\nWith a vast portion of the syllabus, these exams are considerably tough, and mosti.e.ndidates struggle to crack these challenging examinations. Due to a vast syllabus, these examinations need a lot of practice, hard work, and revisions. Though there are a lot of solutions and methodologies to crack these exams, (like the mock tests, adequate study materials, etc.) online courses can be of great help.\n\n#### Some tips to prepare for the CBSE CTET exam\n\n1. Go through the CTET exam paper pattern and syllabus.\n2. Child development and pedagogy are the most scoring sections of this exam. Focus more on these sections.\n3. Read the NCERT books along with the CTET books. NCERT books are very helpful for the preparation of this exam.\n4. Solve mock tests and old question papers associated with this exam.\n5. Thoroughly go through each and every topic of the syllabus.\n\nLast but not least, watch some online courses for extra revisions, tips, and tricks and sharpen your memory to remember all the concepts in the exams.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Free online courses, Professional Online Courses, career planning, online courses India, Professional Courses, Online Courses India\n\n",

Since there are different subjects as part of the test, you need to have a proper study plan.\n2. Identify the subjects which can create problems during preparation.

If you finish all questions before time, these 2-3 minutes can also be used for last-minute checking.

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace, and so are cyber threats. Cybercrime is rising due to computer viruses, malware, credit card fraud, online scams, phishing, identity theft, etc., providing these anti-social elements with easy targets.\n\nAs incidences of such cybercrime keep increasing, the demand for Cybersecurity experts is also rising, making it one of the most sought-after and well-paying career options today.\n\n## What is Cybersecurity:\n\nCybersecurity is a field that protects systems against cyberattacks, including hardware, software and data. People, businesses, financial institutions and government agencies invest in Cybersecurity to protect their data from hackers and cybercriminals. And for this, they need a Cybersecurity expert to help them.\n\n### Who is a Cybersecurity Analyst:\n\n**Cyber analysts **monitor a company’s computer network and systems to safeguard and prevent malicious activities, external threats and unauthorised data access by anti-social elements.\n\n### Cybersecurity analyst job description\n\nAs a **Cyber analyst**, your tasks may differ from one company to another. Some of the essential and general responsibilities in this field are mentioned below:\n\n**Monitoring network:** Cybersecurity analysts must closely monitor all network activities and look out for potential threats and security breaches.\n\n**Software management:** Cyber analysts must install, maintain and update the software on the network and the official systems being monitored. They must continue to audit system flaws to prevent possible attacks.\n\n**Reporting:** Information security analysts must draft a comprehensive report regarding the problems and the measures taken to resolve them.\n\n**Prevent Breaches:** One of the essential roles of a security analyst is to examine security clearances and prevent possible security breaches.\n\n**Ensuring compliance:** An organisation must adhere to several regulatory standards to protect confidential data. A cyber security analyst ensures that the organisation is compliant with the same.\n\n**Training:** Cyber threats can come from any level in an organisation. And hence training and educating all the staff about possible scams, phishing attempts and other malware designed to steal data becomes essential.\n\n**Staying updated: **Technology is forever evolving. Hence the need to stay updated on the latest technologies and advancements in the field of cyber security to meet market demands is of utmost importance.\n\n### Do a Cybersecurity analyst and an information security analyst perform the same role?\n\nA **Cybersecurity analyst** and an **information security analyst** perform similar tasks and are sometimes used interchangeably by companies. But they both have different roles to perform. While Cybersecurity refers to data protection in its digital form, information security protects all kinds of data. A cyber analyst’s role is to secure data stored on electronic devices. And an information analyst has to protect data stored in documents or insider knowledge known to some employees.\n\nAccording to a report by 451 Research, women now make up 34% of the IT workforce in India, with a 50:50 gender parity rate in STEM graduates. The Indian government is pushing for even more women to specialise in Cybersecurity.\n\nAre you interested in starting a career as a **Cybersecurity analyst** or need guidance in understanding the **cybersecurity analyst job description** in detail?

Every decision taken in every firm these days is data-driven. And, data scientists are those who make sense of this data using various tools and help businesses make important decisions and also solve strategic marketing and risk-management problems. If you are someone who has a flair for numbers and loves working with data, then you must take the [online course ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses)on Data Science available on the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) .\n\nAn estimated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every single day, according to IBM. As per statistics, the number of data science jobs is projected to rise by 15% by 2022. The job of a data scientist is one of the highest paying jobs today. So, if you are someone that loves to work in this field, then this is the right time for you to become a data scientist. In case you are unsure about the right path to take for becoming a data scientist, then make use of the free [career guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) available on the Glow & Lovely Careers website.\n\n### What is data science?\n\nData science is a field of study that makes use of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract insights from the data available. It combines statistics, data analytics, machine learning and the knowledge of Maths to make sense of such large amounts of data. The basic requirement of a data scientist is that she should be able to do data mining at a granular level and understand complex behaviours, trends, and patterns observed in a particular set of data.\n\n### What is the right path to becoming a data scientist?\n\nPrimarily, a data scientist should be able to connect science & technology with business. Prospective data scientists should have a deep understanding of statistical and machine learning algorithms. Basically, they should be good at Mathematics, should have a passion for numbers and an analytical mind. Here is the path you can follow to become a data scientist:\n\n1. First, you must study at least one programming language, preferably Python. This will help you to test algorithms and ideas efficiently. The Glow & Lovely Careers provides an online certification course in Python which you can easily study on your own.\n\n2. Next, you should study statistics. Statistics is the practice of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities. Hence, this forms the very base of data science. Do a free online course with certification in statistics on the Glow & Lovely Careers .\n\n3. The next course you should do is Data Visualization. As a data scientist, you will have to work on multiple spreadsheets that contain enormous amounts of data. When you work on many sheets at the same time, you might find it difficult to gain sharp insights. This is where ‘data visualization’ comes into play. It is nothing but the representation of information in the form of a chart, diagram, picture, etc. This will help you to improve your efficiency in working with piles of data and also help you draw insights very quickly. The online data visualization course on the Glow & Lovely Careers website covers the main tasks required from data analysts today, including importing, summarizing, interpreting, analyzing and visualizing data. It aims to equip you with the tools that will enable you to be an independent data analyst.\n\n4. It’s time to get into machine learning now. Once you get a good grip on the aforementioned courses, you can then prepare yourself to study machine learning. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In the world of data science, machine learning is used to identify patterns in data and use them to automatically make predictions or decisions. You can do an online course in Machine Learning[ ](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/course-detail/edX-BerkeleyX+Data8.3x)on the Glow & Lovely Careers website where you will learn how to use machine learning, with a focus on regression and classification, to automatically identify patterns in your data and make better predictions.\n\n5. You must learn advanced machine learning gradually and then learn to deal with unstructured data, as most of the raw data you get will be in an unstructured format.\n\n6. You can become a confident data scientist once you complete a course on Deep Learning as well. Deep Learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.\n\nWith the demand for data scientists being on the rise, this is the best time for you to explore your interest in data interpretation and other related fields and become a successful professional.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Career Guidance, Data Science\n\n",

However, becoming a travel influencer isn't just about taking selfies and posting them online. There is much more to it. Read on to know more.\n\n## What do you need to be an influencer?\n\nYou need to be passionate about travelling to be a travel influencer. You also need a solid social media presence and the ability to communicate your ideas clearly. Below are some tips on how they play into being an influencer:\n\n1. **Passionate about travel:** Travel is an essential part of many people's lives. If this isn't something that speaks directly through your writing style or photos, then it could be difficult for brands or other potential clients to collaborate with you.\n2. **Strong social media presence:** The internet has changed the way we communicate. If someone wants access to specific information about where something is located or what it looks like in person before booking an upcoming trip there, having followers who can help spread this word across their networks would prove invaluable! This means having at least 500 followers on Instagram before considering yourself successful enough, but don't worry too much about numbers here. What matters most is whether those followers care enough about what type of content makes up each post/video.\n3. **Amplify your social media reach:** You can increase the number of people who see your posts by using the \"Share\" button on each one. If you have a large following, this will also help you grow it!\n4. **Use the best networks for you**: Each network has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Twitter is great for sharing links but less good at sharing videos or images; Instagram is better at video than Twitter; Facebook tends to have more followers than any other platform. What matters is getting enough attention, so people actually want to follow YOU instead of just another random account.\n5. **Create entertaining content: **Your audience wants to be engaged and inspired by the things you're sharing, so make sure it's something that they'll enjoy reading or watching. Use photos and videos if possible. If you don't have access to professional-looking equipment, try using stock photography instead! Include hashtags, as they can help people find your content and boost engagement.\n\nRemember, if you want to be a travel influencer, your authenticity is key. Be yourself—don't try to be someone else or pretend that life is perfect when it's not. People like authentic people because they're more relatable and easier to connect with. Everyone has their preference when it comes to food, drink and activities. Don't ever feel pressured. If something doesn't work for you, then don't do it! Now that you have some information about the industry, it's time to start your journey.

Most of the time, it goes something like this in their minds: You will be very successful if you have an idea, start a business, get customers, and then grow quickly.\n\nBut it's not usually that easy in real life. Building a business isn't easy and takes a lot of hard work. But it doesn't have to be impossible if you have a well-thought-out plan. Your business plan can put you on the road to success if you plan it carefully and carry it out well.\n\nThe key is to think things through and build something on a solid base that won't fall apart when bad things happen. Every business needs a solid base to stand on. It's essential to have many of these things in place early on, like your website, business plan, and online marketing.\n\n1. **Start with your passion:**\n\nThe startup world is not for the weak of the heart; if you don't care about what you're doing, everyone will know it. If your main goal is to make money, everyone will know it. Passion doesn't guarantee success, but not having it makes it likely that you'll fail.\n\n1. **Have a Realistic Plan:**\n\nStretch goals are a great way to get people excited, but they usually can't be reached in the future. Instead, entrepreneurs would do better to have a business plan with reasonable and doable milestones. The milestones could be as easy as getting enough money, hiring the best people, and growing reasonably. These are goals that can get you where you want to go.\n\n1. **Solve a real problem with your product: **\n\nToo many businesses fail because they tried to solve a problem they thought existed. Figure out what you'll be selling, who you'll be selling it to, and how you'll be selling it. Make sure the market for your product or service is big enough that you only need to sell to a small part of it to be successful.\n\n1. **Build an inner circle:**\n\nFind ways to connect with people who are leaders in the field you want to be in and build a close group of people you trust. To help you make decisions, you'll need to have a lot of years of experience on speed dial.\n\n1. **Have a business website and use social media:**\n\nIf you want to reach your goal, you have to be online. Your website will connect you with customers who live thousands of miles away.\n\n1. ** Put together a strong team:**\n\nMake sure to find the right people with the skills your company needs right now. Make sure to add people in a smart way, and don't feel rushed to fill positions on time.

Apart from the kind of hectic lifestyle women lead today, other reasons for the fitness industry to boom in India are the increasing diet consciousness and demand for healthy food, free online exercise classes, budget-friendly gyms, and more. In recent years, we have had an array for women entering the health & fitness industry in the form of trainers, dieticians, fitness entrepreneurs and more. The Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) encourages every woman that wishes to realize her professional dreams by providing expert [online career guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance), [free online courses,](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) [career tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance), various free career-related tools and more.\n\n## Here are a few fitness-related areas where women are leaving their stamp:\n\n### Yoga\n\nAlthough Yoga is an age-old form of mental and physical exercise done for health and relaxation, recently we have seen an influx of a large number of women into this realm. All of these women believe in sustainable results with a focus on the quality of movement and that will make you fit from within instead of just having weight loss. Some of the notable women in this field are Urmi Kothari, Shalini Bhargava and more.\n\n### Zumba\n\nZumba is a fitness program that combines Latin and international music with dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate alternating fast and slow rhythms and resistance training. Owing to the kind of exercise form that Zumba is, it has been catching on very well with the youth and the elderly people of the country. Sucheta Pal is country’s first Zumba Education Specialist (ZES) and was recognized as brand ambassador for Zumba by Zumba Miami in 2016 and was one among the 140 select master trainers in the world.\n\n### Pilates\n\nPilates is a form of exercise which concentrates on strengthening the body with an emphasis on core strength. This helps to improve general fitness and overall well-being. Namrata Purohit is a celebrity Pilates instructor and is the official fitness expert to The Femina Miss India International pageant since 2011. Among her notable achievements is the publishing of her first book “The Lazy Girls Guide to Being Fit” at the age of 21.\n\n### Nutrition\n\nThere has been growing concern over eating patterns of the youth these days. Nutritionists are professionals who are trained to provide advice and counseling about food and nutrition. They use the best available evidence coupled with good judgment about the client’s or communities’ unique values and circumstances to provide guidance and recommendations. Rujuta Diwekar is a celebrity nutritionist and author and has many stars attached to her names such as Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan & more. She is also the author of seven books on health and nutrition.\n\nThere are many more women actively involved in the health & fitness industry like Yasmin Karachiwala (Celebrity fitness trainer), Pooja Makhija (Nutritionist), Cindy Jourdain (CrossFit, Thai Boxing, and Yoga), Shwetambari (Fitness Expert), etc. The opportunities for growth in this field are endless today.

It introduces you and shows your interests, achievements, hopes, and aspirations to the HR. This is what makes objectives so important. You are convincing the HR of an organization to hire you based on what they can read.\n\nWhile your interests, hobbies and achievements are all about you. Your hopes and aspirations regarding the job you are applying to are different. This is the 'objective' of sending the resume to the HR. The objective is what convinces the HR that you are a good fit for the company.\n\nSo what constitutes a good objective? Read on to find out:\n\nYour resume objective must be 2 to 3 sentences long and must contain the following:\n\n- An introduction to yourself\n- The job title you are applying for/ what you are looking for in the company\n- A couple of key skills/ what you bring to the company\n\nYour skills can talk about your experience and should work to impress the recruiter.\n\n**Here's an example:** A mass communications fresher with volunteering experience in event management. Seeking a PR position at XYZ company to apply my organizational, communication and public relation skills.\n\nThis is the ideal resume objective format. Just customize it to fit yourself, and you are almost done. However, there are a couple of points to keep in mind:\n\n1. Your objective should never be generalised. Write it such that it seems to fit the job you are applying for. For instance, writing that you are skilled in communication isn't going to impress anyone hiring for a software engineering job. Similarly, writing only 'fresher looking for writing job' without the other parts is not favoured.\n2. The skills that you include should be company focussed. Yes, you are talking about yourself. But a skill that doesn't help the company will not win you points. You could be good at writing, but will that help you in a technical job. On the other hand, writing would be an excellent skill to mention when applying for a journalism post.\n3. Bragging is not going to help you here. Make sure you have facts to back up what you say. For instance, in the above example, if you have not managed to gain any contacts through your volunteering experience, do not mention public relations at all.\n4. You can choose to add a long term career goal. For instance, in the above example, you could talk about your ambition to become the Head of Event Planning. However, ensure that your goal is related to the current company that you are applying to. Talking about your long term goal of becoming a dancer will not help you.\n5. Write your objective in simple words. It makes you seem more friendly and likeable. Using big and uncommon words might make you seem like an arrogant know-it-all.\n\nNow that you are aware of what you should and shouldn't do while writing a resume objective, try making your resume. Glow & Lovely Careers (formally known as The Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) offers a free [resume builder](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/free-online-resume-builder) that you can use to impress the HR.

This is why having your own career map or path to follow is very essential. You can gain clarity on setting goals and much more with the help of career guidance and counselling. So let’s understand more about this.\n\n## What Is Career Guidance And Counselling?\n\nCareer Guidance is about having support from a coach/mentor you can speak with to overcome the challenges you are facing in terms of your career goals.\n\nCareer Guidance is needed if you see yourself in any of the following situations:\n\n- You are at a stage in life where you want to change your career.\n- You have completed your education but feel unprepared for the work field.\n- You feel unsure about the type of career you want to pursue.\n- You want to develop goals and dreams for yourself but don’t know where to start.\n- You are unsure about which degree or course you should go after for a better salary.\n- You need advice on how to explore the job market and do job searches.\n\nOverall, if you feel stuck about starting or changing a career, then getting career guidance can make a huge difference! This concept also applies to anyone who needs help in deciding what to study further.\n\n## What Are The Benefits Of Career Guidance?\n\n### Benefit 01 - You Get Clarity On Your Skill Set\n\nIn a career guidance session, your mentor will try to understand the skill sets you already have. You fill out a psychometric career test where your answers give hints about the things you enjoy doing. Knowing your own personality and things you normally like doing is the first step to building your career.\n\n*Imagine this scenario*,\n\nYour career test result displays qualities such as you are organised and good at problem solving. Now there are thousands of jobs that are looking for exactly this set of skills in a job candidate.\n\nWhen you know that these are your strong points, you can present yourself better in an interview. The test answers such questions and makes you more confident about how you present your personality to others.\n\nEnd result - Your personality is evaluated which gives you a clear understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to identify qualities that make up your personality. You will know if you are more extroverted or introverted. This will help you know the types of jobs you would prefer.\n\n### Benefit 02 - You Are Able To Identify Your Career Options\n\nIt’s true that you can plan your career better when you have some guidance. A career expert will help give you some direction when it comes to finding a job that matches your personal interests.\n\nYou will not be provided with one ultimate career option, but you will be given a wide variety of [exciting jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs) to choose from.\n\n*Imagine this scenario*,\n\nIf you love creating lesson plans or taking tuition, then it is possible that you can make a career in teaching. But under the industry term ‘Teaching’ there are several career options you can choose from. Those who are fit to be teachers can also be good at job roles like:\n\n- Corporate Trainer\n- Admissions counsellor\n- Museum Tour Guide\n- Curriculum Designer\n- School Psychologist\n\nIf you have the qualities to be a teacher, it does not mean you can only work inside a classroom. You can explore more career options beyond that. This is something a career counsellor would be able to help with.\n\nEnd result - You will get suggestions for 4 or 5 different [career options](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options) depending on skills you already have. If you love finance and accounting, then your career expert will explore all the different types of job roles you can try for.\n\n### Benefit 03 - You Get Constructive Feedback\n\nYour career counsellor is not only present to listen to you. They will also provide you with valuable feedback. During the one-on-one session with your counsellor, make sure you ask as many questions. Clarify your doubts and take as many suggestions as possible.\n\n*Imagine this scenario*,\n\nYour counsellor notices that you are not confident when speaking in English. So they suggest that you register for a '[Personality Development](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=personality-development)’ or a ‘[Talk In English](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/englishedge-915/lets-talk-in-english-(english))’ course. Your counsellor will recommend classes or courses to you. Their main focus will always be to make you a better speaker and version of yourself. This is one of the many upsides of taking career guidance - the feedback helps your personal growth and development.\n\nEnd Result - By taking the feedback from the career guidance test or session, you learn about any mistakes to avoid.\n\nYou can then make changes and improve on skills that you currently have not worked on yet. Sometimes feedback is tough to hear but on a positive note, it’s just suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Benefit 04 - You Are Not Misled\n\nNowadays the internet is filled with so much information. Colleges and universities put up advertisements for coaching classes and more. But some of them make false promises. It is hard to pick which ones are true to what they say. It’s easy to rush into taking up things and get convinced by advertisements. So it may be necessary to discuss the right steps to take with your counsellor.\n\nYour counsellor will have enough expertise to identify if the information is a misleading advertisement.\n\nBefore sharing any information with you, a career counsellor will assess whether it is logical and rational enough. This in turn will help you make a more informed decision.\n\n*Imagine this scenario,*\n\nYou see an advertisement promising that they can prepare you for a competitive exam in days when in reality it takes months to prepare. Before enrolling, you can ask your career guidance counsellor to know if it’s an advisable choice or not.\n\nAs a counsellor is an expert, he/she can help you go in the right direction.\n\nEnd Result - You get an expert opinion on a career or education decision you’re taking. Instead of depending only on friends or advertisements that can be misleading for career advice, you can additionally have your counsellor to count on for his/her expertise.\n\n## What Is The Outcome Of Career Guidance And Counselling?\n\nCareer guidance covers plenty of things but it is mainly a time for self-reflection. Through the practice of taking a career test, you will be able to list out your talents and strengths.\n\nIt’s recommended to visit a career counsellor in person to have a face-to-face conversation. But in case you don’t know of a career guidance counsellor or don’t have the time, you can also opt for online counselling.\n\nThese sessions build confidence in your abilities. You begin to pay special attention to your needs instead of just following what others love doing. You take a step back and really give thought to what YOU want to do with your career and education.\n\nWhen you look at your career guidance test report, you will also pause to consider what you are good at. Lastly, you realise that you are not alone with the challenges you face but you will have a mentor to guide you.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nTalking to a career expert helps you discover new different kinds of job opportunities that you may have missed out on. Don’t let your dream sink but make it grow by getting career guidance. Gain from your career counsellor’s knowledge, take a [free career test](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) to examine your skills and experience the difference it can make.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What Is The Importance Of Career Guidance?\n\nCareer guidance is worth it when you do not know how to build and grow your career. When you have no clue about where to start, this is when career guidance is a blessing. You get the right amount of help and learn more about the skills you have. This leads you to success and being more confident about the dreams you have.\n\n### What Is Meant By Career Guidance?\n\nChoosing a career path is a difficult decision. And it gets even more stressful when you have to make career choices all by yourself. This is when you might look out for some advice and support. Career guidance is all about that. It directs you towards making career choices that you are happy with.\n\n### What Is The Aim Of Career Guidance?\n\nThe aim of career guidance is to prepare you to make career choices by yourself with confidence. A career test or guidance counsellor will point you in the right direction by identifying the skills you have. After that, you will also be provided with the career options that you will enjoy the most. During the entire process, you learn more about yourself and this makes you take a good decision about your career.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Career Guidance, Importance Of Career Guidance, Importance Of Career Counselling, psychometric career test, free career test, Career Planning\n\n",

But beauty courses give you some understanding of the do’s and don’ts for clients.\n\nYou’ll understand the reason behind applying a certain skin product only for a certain skin type.

But feeling like you do not know words in the language you have to speak in makes it worse. Developing your vocabulary is the first step to becoming a better public speaker. It will positively affect your public speaking and speech writing. Additionally, it will also improve your oral and written communication skills. This will help you express yourself.\n\n## Here are six steps to improve your vocabulary and public speaking skills.\n\n### Step 1\n\nIf you are looking to improve your vocabulary, you must make a regular commitment. Make time for it every day or at least every week. Reserve time in your day to learn and use new words.\n\nThere are many ways to do this - you can use a dictionary or subscribe to an app. Many websites give you the 'word of the day,' as well.\n\n### Step 2\n\nAnother way to improve your vocabulary is to read. Reading is highly recommended. Turn it into a habit and ensure you read at least a bit every day. If you find yourself making excuses, you can also opt for a reading challenge. Reading at a fixed time every day, like at lunch or just before bed, increases the chances of making it a habit. Remember to underline new words. Keep a dictionary beside you to look them up. Using a physical dictionary is a better option than one on the phone. This is because you can get distracted when using the phone.\n\n### Step 3\n\nKeep a vocabulary notebook. Write it down in your notebook every time you learn a new word. Include the word's meaning, an example of the word in a sentence, and words with the same and opposite meaning. This way, you may learn more words. As an exercise, you can write down sentences you've made with each word in your book.\n\n### Step 4\n\nLearn the most commonly used words that are associated with public speaking. It is a good idea to be familiar with terms such as props, visuals, brainstorming, spontaneous, and nonverbal communication.\n\n### Step 5\n\nWatching videos of public speakers will help you out a lot. You can also read famous speeches. Remember to write down vocabulary words while you do so. You are learning to improve your vocabulary from the best by listening to and reading famous speeches. These videos are available online. As you note your new and commonly used words, also write down examples of how you can use them while speaking at a public speaking event.\n\n### Step 6\n\nAfter writing your speech or presentation, sit with a dictionary and go through it all again. Often, we don't realise that we have reused the same word multiple times. You can change it to a synonym with the help of a dictionary. Write down these newly used words in your vocabulary notebook and remember to use them the next time.\n\nGlow and Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) provides [free online courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) to improve your vocabulary, speaking skills, confidence and more.

In less than 10 years!\n\nThink beautiful Chanderi sarees, hand-painted Kalamkari pallus and artistic Bandhej dupattas, and soft cotton summer dresses….and that is what The Indian Ethnic Co is all about.\n\nTo describe simply, The Indian Ethnic Co is an online platform that promotes and sells beautiful handmade clothing and handicrafts online.\n\nToday, we speak to the girl behind this venture – Lekhinee Desai.\n\n### Thank you, Lekhinee, for agreeing to speak to us. And congratulations on The Indian Ethnic Co being such a great success! Before we go ahead, can you tell us about The Indian Ethnic Co – how it all started?\n\nI come from a middle-class family. We are not a business family. I am also a dancer. I have learned Odissi. Starting my own business was not something that I had planned initially.\n\nMy sister and I always wore clothes which our mother designed. We never liked what was available in the market. Most of the time, the designs did not match our taste. And the ones we liked were very costly.\n\nSo, mom always designed our clothes and got them stitched from a local tailor.\n\nWe had gone to a handloom exhibition, my mother and me. That's where the idea of designing beautiful clothing from Indian textiles struck us.\n\n### We invested all our savings – around 50,000 and started The Indian Ethnic Co.\n\n#### Tell us about the first few days of The Indian Ethnic Co.\n\nI was studying in college when we started this business. We didn't have big budgets then – to hire professional models to advertise our creations, rent an office space or hire people. But I knew this business had potential.\n\nMy first model was my sister. We made her try the dresses, clicked pictures, and posted them online. Being an online setup helped us a lot. We were able to respond to customers quickly. Online marketing has a huge role to play in our success.\n\nThe bedroom was our office. My mom was our designer. And I was in charge of marketing, responding to customers, etc.\n\nThat's it. The initial team was me, my mother, and my sister.\n\n### But I knew this business had potential. Our first design – we sold it overnight.\n\n#### What about advertisements?  You used social media.\n\nWe followed a different advertising approach. Advertising via social media – Facebook, Instagram, etc.\n\nI am a trained Odissi dancer. To advertise our products, we danced to different songs – many times using Odissi as a base.\n\nThe idea was to showcase our products but in a different manner.\n\n### And your idea paid off. I have heard that The Indian Ethnic Co is now a case study on advertising using social media.\n\nYes. Instagram and Facebook use us as a case study. Give our example on how to use social media effectively.\n\n*-----------------*\n\n*There are also a lot of free *[*online courses*](https://caa.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/searchResult?searchKey=Social%20Media%20Marketer)* on Social Media Marketing on this site which you can check out to know how you too can use the power of Social Media to your advantage.*\n\n*-----------------*\n\n### From a 50,000 investment, you have grown to a 10-crore revenue-making business. That's fantastic. So, do you still operate out of that one-bedroom in your flat?\n\nWe have three offices now. And easily sell around 3000 clothes in a month. We have now hired people.\n\n#### What were the challenges that you had to face while establishing this business?\n\nThe first was the decision to start this business. As I said, I do not come from a business family. We were always taught to value things in life.\n\nEven with clothes, if my mom stitched a kurta for me, the rest of the cloth would be used to stitch a skirt for my sister. So, investing 50,000 in business was not exactly a small amount for us.\n\nI was in college when we started. I used to look at Marketing and Customer service.\n\nAnswering a customer's question promptly is important. So even while attending lectures, I used to be on my phone simultaneously. Managing clients.\n\nAfter my MBA, I got a job with ITC in Chennai. My family was in Mumbai, and I was a trainee with ITC in Chennai. I had to prove myself there too. 11 months I was away from family. In Chennai. Handling both – the business as well as my job.\n\nIt was not easy. But giving up was never an option. This is something that my parents taught me at an early age.\n\nThen I took the difficult decision to devote myself to the business full time. It was a risk.

After becoming a mother, she couldn’t find healthy snacks for her kids. So she made her own company that offers nutritious snacks for small children.\n\nTo build this company, she took the support of another mother and good friend Shreya Lamba. Both mothers, Farah and Shreya, supported each other on this business journey.\n\n### Converting Challenges Into Opportunities\n\nAs new mothers, both Farah and Shreya had difficulties in finding healthy snacks for their kids.\n\nThey discovered that the snacks available for kids are mostly full of preservatives and sugar.\n\nBut they wanted a snack that was nourishing and healthy for small kids. Instead of waiting for someone to make such a snack, Farah and Shreya decided to do something about it!\n\nThat’s why they founded The Mumum Company in 2017.\n\n### By A Mother, For Mothers, With Help Of Other Mothers\n\nIt is not easy to create a new product from scratch. For this, a lot of research is required. Farah had to research whether kids would like the taste of the snack.\n\nThis was where her partner Shreya helped her out. Shreya knew many mothers. Together, Farah and Shreya got in contact with many women to spread the news about their product. They also got feedback on whether their kids loved the snack.\n\nThe first snack product they made was ‘Crunchies’. This is a puff snack made of jowar, ragi, and corn. These are nutritious ingredients that are easily found in the Indian market.\n\nThey also created a drink made of natural fruits, which is much healthier than soft drinks that have artificial sweeteners in them.\n\nToday, the snacks they created are sold in several stores in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Pune. They also sell their products online on websites like FirstCry and Amazon.\n\nBoth Farah and Shreya have worked as a team and with a lot of passion. Because of this, The Mumum Company has achieved success and continues to be so!\n\n*If you also have a startup idea, there are plenty of online courses like *[*Introduction to Marketing*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/edx-ubcx+comm420x/introduction-to-marketing)* that teach key ideas of marketing products or services. *[*Marketing Internships*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/internships)* also give fair knowledge on the marketing industry.*\n\n### Combining Motherhood And A Business Spirit\n\nUsually, there is pressure on women to leave their careers after becoming mothers. Women are told to choose one between the two - motherhood or career. Many are also told that they cannot excel at both motherhood and career. One of them is bound to suffer. However, Farah and Shreya decided to break this barrier and expand their horizons.\n\nThey made motherhood their biggest strength and created a career that helped with the growth of kids. As a bonus, they also helped other mothers to provide healthy snacks to kids.\n\nFarah and Shreya’s success proves that women don’t have to sacrifice their careers. But being creative and looking for opportunities can help you grow.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Success Stories, Inspiring Story, women success stories, Inspirational Women in India\n\n",

Her father did not allow it. But protecting people was Mehrunnisha's calling. Today, she is living her dream – but just a little differently.\n\n30 year old Mehrunnisha Shaukat Ali works as a bouncer in Delhi. She also holds a Master's degree in Hindi literature.\n\nHer regular gymming routine and karate training helped her get a job as a bouncer. Today, she works at one of Delhi's most popular restaurants and nightclubs – Hauz Khas Social.\n\nHer younger sister, 27-year-old Tarannum, also works as a bouncer. Today, together, they earn enough to take care of their family of 8 people.\n\nBoth sisters are proud of what they do and take all possible efforts to be the best at their job. The sisters do not take their jobs lightly and spend an hour in the gym daily, working during holidays if necessary.\n\n\"I am very proud of what I do; it's not an easy job,\" Mehrunnisha once said. \"Taking care of people, especially women in a club, is a huge responsibility.\"\n\nWhile Mehrunnisha may be India's first female bouncer, she wanted to be in the Indian army or become a police officer. But her orthodox father didn't support her dream.\n\nIn fact, her family was so conservative that they did not want her to study beyond the 5th standard. It was only because of her mother that she was sent to school.\n\nWith this background, it seemed like there was no chance that Mehrunnisha would ever become a working girl. Becoming a police officer or a bouncer seemed next to impossible.\n\nBut Mehrunnisha was determined. So Mehrunnisha secretly joined NCC (National Cadet Corps).\n\nAfter successful completion of her course and training, she brought her uniform home. But her angry father burnt it on the stove at home.\n\nAnd that may have been the end of her dreams. But both Mehrunnisha and destiny had other plans….\n\nMehrunnisha's father suffered losses in the stock market. Mehrunissha decided to help her family and take up a job to support them. She was initially the only breadwinner of the family.\n\nShe then realised that she could still pursue her dream of 'protecting people' partially, if not entirely. So she got a job as a bouncer at a Social, a famous restaurant cum nightclub in Delhi, to become the ***first female bouncer of India***.\n\nDuring the ten years as a bouncer, she also did freelance security work for various events such as the IPL matches, reality show auditions, film promotions, corporate launches etc.\n\nShe also worked for many celebrities, including Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Vidya Balan and Deepika Padukone, during events in Delhi.\n\nToday Mehrunnisha is everything that she was told she could not be. She is the breadwinner in her family. The most extensive support of her parents. Looks after her sisters and younger brother. Whenever people come to know that she is a bouncer, there is a look of respect on their faces.\n\nMehrunnisha is an inspiration for any girl who wants to do something different. And do it with pride. As Mehrunnisha once said, \"(Today) my mother and father have faith and confidence in me, and I know I am not doing anything wrong.\"\n\nWith determination and dedication, Mehrunnisha has written her own success story.

After she completed her studies, she worked for a financial services company American Express in Gurgaon. But she also had a creative side that loved everything about the beauty and fashion industry.\n\nTo explore this passion, she started her blog called Peaches & Blush. This was just the beginning of Mehak's journey to changing her career path completely.\n\n### Facing Challenges While Planning Her Own Wedding Was The Foundation For Her Success Later\n\nPeaches & Blush was a beauty and fashion blog that Mehak did as a hobby. She wrote content on her blog alongside her job as a data modeller at American Express.\n\nAt that time, she had no plans of having her own wedding planning company. She was at a stage in life where she was planning her own wedding and was new to the city of Hyderabad.\n\nShe had a very difficult time finding a wedding venue, photographer, or makeup artist in the city. She wrote about all the difficulties she faced to plan her wedding in a new city on her blog.\n\n### She Converted The Problem Into An Opportunity\n\nMany people started reading it, and she got a huge following on her blog for this story. This got her thinking. She researched on the internet and found that there are very few online platforms in India that help brides plan their weddings.\n\nWhere many people would find a problem, Mehak found a business opportunity! She decided to create a company that helps anyone getting married find photographers, venues, makeup artists, cakes, wedding entertainment, and much more with ease.\n\nWhen Mehak started WedMeGood, she left her full-time job and didn't have sufficient knowledge about how to run a company.\n\nShe had to learn everything about [social media and digital marketing](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/edx-ubcx+comm420x/introduction-to-marketing) so that she could run her company. This was a completely new field for her, but she learned everything from the ground level.\n\n### The Start Was Difficult, But Soon She Saw Success\n\nIn the beginning, Mehak struggled with understanding technology. But after a few years, she built her tech team that helps with keeping her website up and running. She started the company in 2014, and every year she learned something new.\n\nToday, her 8-year-old company is no longer just a startup. WedMeGood has an app with more than 1 million users who have downloaded and used the app. Her website is also one of the leading websites on which Indians go to plan their beautiful weddings.\n\nMehak's company makes sure that Indian brides no longer have to struggle to plan their weddings. Her beautiful creation, WedMeGood, is a true gift to anyone planning a wedding all because she believed in her idea!\n\nMehak was an economics student who decided to try succeeding in another field. It is quite natural to be nervous when one does not have enough professional knowledge or experience. But Mehak did not let that affect her. Instead, she decided to convert a challenge into an opportunity and learn something new.\n\nToday there are many girls like Mehak who wish to do something different and seek knowledge in a field that is different from their graduation or post graduation. There are many [free online courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) for such girls.

They are unarguably just as essential to the nation as men when it comes to contributing to the nation's progress. Women are now playing notable roles in developing our culture and economy. They are now considered to be the forces that develop the country.\n\nOnce confined to household chores, women today can make a perfect balance between their household and professional lives. No wonder, then, they adorned high offices and respectable posts. Women are becoming aware of their strengths and capabilities. They are exploring different opportunities and are getting into professions that were once male-dominated. In fact, there is no field which has remained unconquered by women.\n\nLet’s take the police department, for instance. **Women cops** were unheard of. They were restricted to the desk and clerical jobs in law enforcement. They worked in juvenile facilities and used to handle crimes involving female offenders. Women were considered less capable and brave than men in the police department. But times are changing. Women are accepting new challenges and roles. They are proving themselves in terms of both physical strength and valour.\n\nIn a recent incident, two **female police **constables displayed exemplary courage and bravery to stop a bank robbery. The two **female police** personnel, Juhi Kumari and Shanti Kumari, were guarding the Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank in Senduari Chowk of Sadar police station area when three men tried to enter with the intention to rob the bank.\n\nJuhi and Shanti Kumari inquired about their identity and asked them for their documents. One among them immediately drew a pistol at them. Juhi and Shanti did not hesitate for a moment. They immediately got on their feet and fought them bravely.\n\nThe robbers tried to snatch their rifles, but these two brave police women had decided no matter what, they would not let them rob the bank. The robbers were alarmed by their determination. This led to a confrontation, and in the course of action, Juhi was injured. Eventually, the robbers gave up and fled the crime scene. The entire incident was captured on the bank’s CCTV camera.\n\nThe video footage went viral and got everyone talking about Juhi and Shanti’s **inspiring story** of bravery. People across the country applauded and praised them for their courage.\n\nTo become a brave and fearless policewoman, you must always be prepared. You must educate yourself and undergo rigorous training. While women still account for a very small percentage of the workforce, some believe that women make better police officers as women are specially gifted. They are compassionate and encourage teamwork. Women are better at communication when compared to men. Women are calm and can often help stop violence before they erupt.\n\nIf Juhi and Shanti’s story has inspired you and you wish to become a **female cop**, [Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) can offer you [Online test](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-tests), [Courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) and [expert guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** women cops, female police, Inspiring Story, motivational stories, Success Stories, Inspirational Women in India\n\n",

Students spend a lot of time, money and energy to prepare for these tests. Coaching classes, mock tests, and hours of preparation…. students and their parents put in all their efforts. The aim is to crack these tests.\n\nIt was the same case with Aditi too. This girl from Ludhiana, Punjab, had worked hard to crack IIT-JEE. She was naturally disappointed when she did not clear the exam.\n\nHowever, what she did after that is what makes Aditi's story so special.\n\n**She did not let disappointment discourage her.

Aditi had it all!\n\n**In spite of all this success, Aditi still thought about her IIT -JEE exam. The experience of not cracking this exam had stayed with her….**\n\nWhen Aditi could not crack the exam, instead of getting discouraged, she analyzed what went wrong.\n\nShe realized she was comparatively weak in Chemistry. So, she should have spent more time on that subject. However, Aditi did not get the guidance she needed at that time.\n\nSo, Aditi decided to start something that would provide students with proper guidance to crack competitive exams like IIT-JEE, BITSAT, and CET.\n\n**Aditi came back to India. She spoke to students in various cities. She wanted to understand the problems they faced during exams. Based on her research and experience, Aditi launched Embibe.com. **\n\n**Aditi thus converted her loss into gain.

Aspiring to become a sales professional is not at the top of the list for most young girls due to several reasons. A few of them could be the amount of work stress in sales roles or even the uncertainty of landing a sales job among the male competition out there. Yet, sales are one of the highest-paying professions and Glow & Lovely Careers believes that girls are well suited for these lucrative careers.\n\nThe sales profession has many negative perceptions attached to it. Many people believe sales is too physically tiring for girls, there’s too much travel involved, the conditions are too rough or unsafe for girls. These reasons were not daunting enough for Krishna Chaurasiya to shy away from this challenging profession.\n\n## If you are a young woman who is on the fence about making your profession in sales, read the inspiring and successful journey of Krishna Chaurasiya who jump-started her career forward despite the competition and challenges.\n\n### 1. Would you like to tell us where are you from, what is your family background and educational background?\n\nI am a resident of village Biloua, district Gwalior. I was born on 2, June 1993. We are a family of seven individuals, and being the eldest one, I feel I hold the major chunk of responsibilities for my family. I am a postgraduate in psychology from Jiwaji University.\n\n### 2. What is your inspiration behind choosing your career in Sales?\n\nWomen are great in sales, especially referral sales. But many of us have not explored it. The truth is that our brain is hard-wired differently than men. I have always been good at making time to build trusted, strong, and long-lasting business relationships. Thus, the sales profession always attracted me and I hold pride in being a sales representative.\n\n### 3. How did you get guidance on your dream career?\n\nOnline resources have played a major role in guiding me. I started my career as a sales promoter in Big Bazaar, and that is when I explored and trusted this profession and realized it is for me! Every aspiring girl should try out sales roles, get career guidance and try online courses in sales and marketing to really understand the field.\n\n### 4. What are the common hurdles you faced during your career?\n\nThe amount of work pressure, interaction with so many people, and the dynamics of the job get a little overwhelming at times. However, my passion and determination for the sales profession were so strong that no obstacle could shake my journey.\n\n### 5. What motivated you to choose this career path?\n\nIt was a matter of pride for me to make my career in sales and my need is to constantly learn and evolve with everything that the profession has to offer.\n\n### 6. What are the challenges you faced during your career, for example, family opposition or financial hurdles, and how did you overcome the same?\n\nMy family has always been supportive. I never faced any family opposition; in fact, I got a lot of help from my parents and siblings. However, there were a few financial constraints at the beginning of my journey, which slowly got ironed out as I progressed in my career.\n\n### 7. What are the actions you have taken independently to pave your path to progress?\n\nIf you are honest with yourself and your career, progress is certain.\n\n### 8. Can you tell us the best and the most challenging part of your job?\n\nBoth the best, as well as the challenging part of the job is to ACHIEVE your TARGET.\n\n### 9. Do you think that the internet is a good platform to take up online sales courses to boost your career in sales?\n\nYes, the internet is a good platform to take up online sales courses. Today there is no shortage of online learning courses for women and guidance on the internet and other social platforms. The best part is that these courses are usually free so someone who doesn’t know what sales or marketing is about, can easily understand the basics for free.\n\n### 10. Would you like to share something about your professional stint at HUL?\n\nDuring my tenure with the HUL family, I received a lot of support from all the higher officials and colleagues, which is amazing. I feel lucky.\n\n### 11. Do you think there are enough women in the senior management posts in the sales sector?\n\nThere are a lot of challenges when it comes to women working in the sales sector. There is a smaller number of women in the senior management posts in the sales sector in general. Many young women have not thought about the advantages and bright sides of this profession. I suggest young women talk to their friends who are in sales to really understand the positives and negatives of these jobs.\n\n*Glow & Lovely Careers and Hindustan Unilever Limited believe that women are well suited for roles in sales and marketing. They have the brains, the ability to negotiate and communicate, and the determination to succeed.*\n\nIf you’re inspired by Krishna’s story and want to learn about an opportunity for women in sales- Read about the Marketing Executive program at this [link](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/marketing-jobs)\n\nTo read more success stories of women achievers, click [here](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/students-success-stories).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Marketing Jobs, Women in Sales, Career in Sales, Ahilya, Krishna Chaurasiya\n\n",

If you have a love for language, reading, writing, love to always be vigilant about what goes on around you and above all, feel a sense of social responsibility, then the job of a journalist is for you. Journalists are of different kinds; some are reporters, writers, editors, and photographers. The Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) encourages all women that aspire to become journalists through providing expert [career guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) and [free online courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) on the subject.\n\nTo understand in detail about what a journalist’s job entails, we spoke to Disha Shah, who works as Correspondent at Mirror Now- Times Television Network. She came across as a self-motivated woman, who strongly believes that the job of a journalist is solely to bring the truth before the society, and not to influence the thought process of the citizens in any form. Speaking to her enriched our knowledge about journalism.\n\n## Here are some excerpts of the interview we had with her:\n\n### Q) What inspired you to choose the job of a journalist?\n\nAns: It was my father from whom I drew inspiration to become a journalist. My father was a huge follower of the news that was broadcasted on TV and would always keep watching it. I grew up seeing this and was hugely influenced by the sight of reporters standing with a mike, interviewing people. I saw reporters interacting with so many people, asking them questions and traveling to so many places in the world. This thought stayed etched in my mind as I grew up. I was also extremely driven towards doing something for the society and bringing the truth of the matters in front of them. So, after my 12th standard, I decided that I wanted to join the BMM (Bachelors of Mass Media) course and take up journalism later. My parents were extremely supportive of my decision.\n\n### Q)  What are the primary qualities you think a journalist should have?\n\nAns: A journalist should always be at the top of her game. She should be extremely vigilant about what is happening around her and the world, at large. Being passionate about reading, traveling and writing help a lot. We have been taught in our classes that journalists should never give their opinions on TV, and should only do the job of bringing truth in front of the country. She should respect her work a lot and also not take it for granted.\n\n### Q) How do you ensure your work is accurate and factual?\n\nAns: This is the most important part of our job. The only way to ensure that our work is accurate and factual is to access information from reliable sources. Getting the right sources is a very crucial part of the process for us.\n\n### Q) How would you manage the stress of tight deadlines?\n\nAns: We, as journalists, have to meet deadlines, sure. But more importantly, we have been taught that getting the right information across to people is more important than broadcasting any news on TV just in order to meet deadlines. Basically, we only focus on delivering true stories even if that means that we are not the first to bring certain out news.\n\n### Q) How do you stay informed on the news and current events?\n\nAns: I remain constantly in touch with people from my fraternity in order to keep abreast of all the latest news and happenings. I read a number of newspapers every day and browse the internet for news.\n\n### Q) What motivates you as a working woman?\n\nAns: I would like to say that times are changing and I don’t face any discrimination based on gender at my workplace. In this career, value is given only to good quality work and dedication and nothing else. For creating such a balanced environment at work, I would like to applaud Faye D’Souza, Executive Editor of Mirror Now, who motivates all of us to invest our faith entirely in truth and focus only on covering stories that need to be told. The undying passion for my work and guidance from my seniors and colleagues keep motivating me to do better always.\n\nThe Glow & Lovely Careers strives to encourage more people like Disha to come forward and achieve their dream goals.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Planning, Career test online\n\n",

Here are some excerpts of the interview we had with her:\n\n### Q) What inspired you to become a teacher?\n\nAns: Becoming a teacher was a childhood dream of mine. I was always interested in teaching the things I know to the people around me. Now, as a teacher, I am able to influence the lives of hundreds of children and that gives me immense pride and joy. In addition to these things, I also feel that whatever I learn and experience with the children at school helps me train my own kids also accordingly. I am able to apply the positive learnings at school to my own family as well.\n\n### Q) What are the qualities a teacher should possess?\n\nAns: According to me, a teacher should be extremely patient and should be able to understand things from a child’s point of view. She should have a flexible personality and a positive attitude always. She should always keep in mind that her students will get seriously influenced by anything she speaks or does, and hence, it’s important for her to be in her most positive space state of mind at all times. At my school, there are children from various backgrounds and hence, I have to make sure that they mix well with each other without having any cultural differences.\n\n### Q) What are the various activities you involve in, as a teacher?\n\nAns: Apart from teaching academic lessons in the class, a teacher has to involve in various other activities inside and outside of school. Planning has to be done every day as to what lesson to teach in class that day, which involves a lot of reading up on various topics and designing activities for children related to those topics. I also have to take care of certain administrative jobs in school with respect to maintaining registers and logs related to various details of my students, which includes the progress of each student in the academic and personal space.\n\n### Q) What are the perks of being a teacher?\n\nAns: The biggest perk is definitely the respect one gets in the society. No matter where you go, being a teacher always gives you a special place among people. Being a teacher lets you directly influence an individual’s character building and hence, of the society at a larger scale. Apart from these, you get a good number of holidays in a year that you can use to spend with family. The monetary benefits are also quite satisfactory.\n\n### Q) Does the job of a teacher give you a good work-life balance?\n\nAns: Definitely, yes!

This article delves into **investigative journalism**, shedding light on the promising career paths it holds for women journalists in India. **Online and watchdog journalism** opportunities are becoming increasingly prevalent as the digital era unfolds.\n\n## Investigative Journalism in India:\n\n**Investigative journalism** is a powerful tool for bringing hidden truths to light, holding those in power accountable, and influencing positive societal change. In India, where transparency is paramount, the demand for skilled investigative journalists is rising. With their unique perspectives and tenacity, women are finding their place in this critical and impactful field.\n\n### Online Journalism's Rising Influence:\n\nWith the advent of the internet, the landscape of journalism has undergone a revolutionary shift. **Online journalism** has emerged as a force to be reckoned with, offering a platform for real-time reporting and audience engagement. Women journalists harness the power of online platforms to amplify their voices and reach a broader audience, making meaningful contributions to investigative journalism.\n\n### Watchdog Journalism - A Call to Action:\n\n**Watchdog journalism** is crucial in safeguarding democracy by keeping a vigilant eye on those in power. Women journalists increasingly take on the mantle of watchdogs, fearlessly exposing corruption, injustice, and malpractices. Their contributions to the field go beyond mere reporting; they serve as guardians of truth, ensuring the public is well-informed and empowered.\n\n### The Role of Lawsuits, Government Reports, and Tax Records:\n\nInvestigative journalists often navigate a maze of information, including legal battles, **government reports**, and **tax records**, to uncover the truth. **Lawsuits** can be a double-edged sword for journalists, as obstacles and gateways to unearthing hidden facts. When diligently examined, government reports and tax records provide valuable insights into the workings of institutions and individuals, aiding journalists in their pursuit of truth.\n\n### Promising Career Paths for Women:\n\nIn India, women journalists are carving out promising career paths in investigative journalism. The changing dynamics of the media landscape and a growing awareness of the importance of diverse voices create a conducive environment for women to thrive. Newsrooms increasingly recognise the unique perspectives and skills that women bring to the table, fostering an inclusive atmosphere for investigative journalism to flourish.\n\n### Challenges and Triumphs:\n\nWhile investigative journalism holds immense potential for women, it has its challenges. Gender biases, safety concerns, and societal expectations can pose hurdles. However, the triumphs of women journalists who break barriers and uncover hidden truths serve as an inspiration, paving the way for more women to join the ranks of investigative journalism in India.\n\nThe realm of investigative journalism in India is witnessing a paradigm shift, with women journalists at the forefront of this transformation. The convergence of **journalism**, **online journalism**, and **watchdog journalism** has created a fertile ground for women to explore and excel in investigative reporting. As they delve into **lawsuits**, dissect **government reports**, and analyse **tax records**, women journalists unravel stories that shape the nation's narrative. The future of investigative journalism in India looks bright, with women playing a pivotal role in uncovering the truths that matter.\n\nAt [Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation), we believe in empowering women to be independent.

Selecting the appropriate programming language might take a lot of work. Python and Java are the two most popular languages that developers use. Java is used to develop web and desktop applications. At the same time, Python is used to build machine learning applications and data science. Read on to find the answer to the question: **Should I learn Java or Python**?\n\n## Java vs Python: Which is better\n\nJava and Python are two essential programming languages. And hence it becomes difficult to choose between the two. Both are well-accepted and independent of any platform. However, each of them is used for different purposes. And both have their strengths and weaknesses. Let's learn more about them in this article.\n\n**Java**: Java has become an instant hit among web developers and coding professionals since it was introduced in 1995. Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented compiled language, making it a faster option when compared to Python. Java is commonly used in web development, big data and Android app development.\n\n- One of the main benefits of adopting Java is its speed and efficiency. It is also considered one of the easiest coding languages to learn. Other benefits of Java include:\n- The syntax is easy to write. It is easier than C++ and employs automated memory allocation.\n- Java is compatible with any Java Virtual Machine platform like Windows, Unix, iOS and Linux systems.\n- It allows for more flexibility, faster troubleshooting, and the opportunity to reuse code.\n- However, Java consists of many words, resulting in lengthy and complex sentences. Regarding user experience, Java is much weaker when used for mobiles.\n\n**Python**: Python was invented in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It was designed to focus on code readability. Python gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease at which coders could learn the language. Due to its concise syntax, learning this language is much easier and faster than learning Java. And because of its higher flexibility, Python allows developers to use a variety of programming styles while creating programs. It's a popular language used in back-end development and app development. Some of the added advantages of Python are:\n\n- It enables fast development because it's dynamically typed. It tackles situations and challenges faster as it uses asynchronous code.\n- It works on various platforms, including macOS, as long as an interpreter is designed for it.\n- Because of its flexible approach, it is ideal for start-ups.\n- It can be downloaded free of cost!\n- Python may not be an ideal fit for projects that need speed because of its dynamically typed nature; it is slower to execute. It only lets you manage one thread at a time. Python uses up a lot of memory too.\n\n### Java or Python – what should I learn?\n\nYou may now have a brief understanding of both Java and Python. Naturally, the\n\nquestion remains, which is better in **Java vs Python**? What you opt for largely depends on your ambition. You can even choose to learn both of these programming languages too.\n\nGlow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation)\n\nprovides excellent tips, [courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) and [guidance ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance)regarding Java and Python; [click here](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) for more information.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** java vs python, java or python, should i learn java or python, java or python which is better, Online Courses\n\n",

Even auto drivers and paan shops now accept digital payments. There are many well know international players in the market – GooglePay, PayTm, AmazonPay and others. ** **\n\n## Occupying pride of place with these international players is an Indian name – Mobikwik.\n\n**Adding to this pride is the fact that an Indian woman is its co-founder. Meet Upsana Taku, the girl behind Mobikwik. **\n\n### Upasana broke many myths and stereotypes with her career choice.\n\n- **Staying away from home: **Upasana was born in Surat. She moved all the way to Jalandhar in Punjab to study engineering.\n- **Studying industrial engineering**: While many girls her age were busy pursuing more women-oriented courses, Upasana chose a male-dominated, technical field. She decided to pursue industrial engineering.\n- She even went to the USA to complete her MS in Management Science and Engineering. That too from the very **prestigious Stanford University. Upasana was focused right from the beginning! **\n- **Coming back to India: **In the US, Upasana worked on many important projects. These projects were worth millions of dollars.\n\nHer family had reservations about Upasana giving up her comfortable life in the US. After all, she had a stable, successful career there.\n\nUpasana, however, wanted to come back to India. She wanted to contribute to the country.\n\n- **Establishing her own startup: **In India, Upasana met her future husband, Bipin Preet Singh. Together, they started Mobikwik.\n- **Leading finance and technology: ** Upasana broke the stereotype that women find it challenging to handle FinTech (finance and technology). She was the one heading FinTech in Mobikwik. Even before starting MobiKwik, Upasana was successful in FinTech. She held key positions in international companies such as HSBC and PayPal.\n\nUpasana has proven that girls can lead in finance and technology. And achieve success! In 2016, she was featured on the Forbes Asia “Women To Watch” list.\n\n*If like Upasana, you are interested in a career in finance, we have a whole range of *[*free online courses*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/searchResult?searchKey=finance)* for you to help you understand finance better. *\n\n### As a girl and a startup founder, Upasana had to face challenges too. But she did not let them affect her spirits…\n\nWhen Upasana was managing finance at MobiKwik, she would often meet bankers, auditors, and investors. They were usually surprised to see a woman handling finance. Sometimes, they would even request that a male deal with them instead of Upasana.\n\nUpasana did not let such biases affect her. She confidently handled finance as well as technology...\n\n### As a start-up founder, Upasana had to multi-task…\n\nShe was managing finance and hiring people. None of this was easy. She had to find talented people. Then see if they fit with her company's expectations. And then convince them to join a new organization. All this was challenging. But Upasana was not someone who gives up.\n\nHer motto was simple: Kick up a storm or die trying. So Upasana kept trying and managed it confidently.\n\nUpasana was always focused and goal-oriented. Once she decides something, she tries her level best to achieve it.\n\nShe once said, \"Tenacity is key. When you start something new, the ecosystem doesn't accept you easily; people say no. It took us 10 months to get the first bank onboard for wallet loading, while the second one happened in 15 days. It took us 3-4 months to get our first few top merchants in 2014. Within 3-4 months we closed eBay, Domino's, and other large merchants. All because I held on tight.”\n\n**In fact, so dedicated were Upasana and Bipin to their startup that they even took work breaks during their wedding day!**\n\n### Their hard work paid off!

It is what we make out of it. Destiny may carve a path for us. But we decide the end goal. The results are always in our hands.

There are so many [women empowerment and success stories](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/students-success-stories) that we hear today. And yet, Kiran’s story is very different…\n\nKiran Mazumdar came from a well-off family.

At that time, it was not a career that many women would choose.\n\n**She was the only female to enrol in a brewing course. And she topped her class!**\n\n**But Kiran Shaw had her fair share of struggle as a woman entrepreneur**\n\nAfter returning to India for better career prospects, there was not much progress for Kiran in her field for her because ‘Brewery was a man’s work’. Rather than being disappointed, this response laid the founding stone of her company, Biocon Biochemicals.\n\nKiran set up a small infrastructure in the garage of a rented house in Bengaluru. With a meagre 10,000 rupees. Being a young woman made many investors doubt her capabilities. But Kiran did not give up.\n\n**Her efforts bore fruits and soon she found an investor.**\n\nBut there were other challenges too.\n\nKiran Mazumdar was trying to set up a biochemical industry in a country that had the perfect ingredients unsuitable for its survival.\n\n**Uninterrupted power, good quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, and workers with advanced scientific skills were not easily available in India at that time.**\n\n**Slowly but steadily, conditions started improving. Kiran then used her initial earnings to buy an area for Biocon. Her untested business model was now meeting the desired expectations**.\n\nPartnership with Unilever helped in establishing the Biocon we now know. Consistent efforts paired with defying the odds and the approach of creating an alternate route have played in her favour.\n\n**Today, Biocon is not only about brewery. It is also known for producing medicines that help in fighting COVID-19.**\n\nKiran is an inspiration to so many women today. She did not let her gender or age define her capability. Neither did she give up easily. Looking at her, one really believes in the old saying – If you believe it, you can always do it! If things do not happen as planned, there are always alternative options available.\n\nKiran’s story makes us believe that if she can do it, so can we!

Today, Komal is the Senior Director and Head of Engineering and Business Intelligence at Uber****. **\n\nKomal came from a conservative family in Surat. The idea of women working or going away for higher education was not popular.\n\n“*I come from a conservative family. People were loving but not necessarily giving me the right feedback. *\n\n***Back then, traveling 200 km to study, staying in a hostel, was all a no-no. I distinctly remember crying, trying to convince my family this was the right thing for me.” ***\n\n**So Komal rebelled and decided to take up Coding. **\n\n*Having the right career guidance is important. It is easier to succeed when what you are doing matches your interests. *[*To get a free online test in career planning click here!*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance)\n\n**Using education as a ticket to independence **\n\nKomal once said, *“For me, computer engineering became a ticket to freedom, to independence.” *Coding helped Komal explore her career differently. She could move away from social norms that were otherwise tying her down.\n\n**The initial struggle **\n\nIt was not easy though. Komal studied engineering almost 20 – 25 years back. During the 1980s- 1990s. Computers were not easily available then.\n\n***“I had to pay by the hour for computer time!”***\n\nTo save money, Komal started writing software programs on paper first. Then she would run to the local cybercafé and type those programs on the computer.\n\nKomal, however, did not let these challenges discourage her. Instead, she started having fun. She treated these challenges like a game. Writing software programs and testing them gave an outlet to her creativity.\n\n**Converting challenges into opportunities **\n\nKomal’s imagination was strong. She loved solving puzzles and riddles. When the computer programs she wrote didn’t work, she treated them like a puzzle. It was her version of a video game.\n\n**Breaking society’s rules **\n\n**After graduation, Komal joined Wipro as a software engineer. The society, however was not happy. At that time, people thought a working woman meant the family was poor. **\n\nAt that time, Komal’s father supported her.\n\n**Taking up a job…... Going away from home to pursue a career…. Pursuing Technology, which was predominantly a male-dominated profession…... Komal kept breaking the typical norms. **\n\n**Taking these risks paid off**\n\nThe job in Wipro as a software engineer was the start of a successful career. Due to her background with Wipro, Komal could shift to the US. There she got an opportunity to work with Oracle in the US.\n\nLater she joined Uber and has been in the news ever since! Today, Komal is a senior Director in Uber and heads engineering and business intelligence.\n\n**Komal on girls entering the world of Technology**\n\n**Komal's advice to girls wanted to enter Technology is that they should broaden the definition of Technology. Match using Technology with their interests. She gives an example of YouTube and Facebook. **\n\n**One may be developing the next YouTube because she or she likes love watching videos. Similarly, one may create the next Facebook because he/she likes to socialize. **\n\n*Having the right career guidance is important. It is easier to succeed when what you are doing matches your interests. *[*To get free career guidance about your dream career, click here!*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options)\n\nAccording to Komal, having an equal number of men and women in Technology is beneficial to business. Since women think differently and bring a unique approach to solving problems – which may be different from a man’s approach.\n\nKomal is a strong supporter of women joining Technology. She is on board of communities such as Women Who Code and Girls Who Code – organizations that help girls make a career in Technology.\n\nIn fact, Komal was also instrumental in Uber donating more than a million dollars to Girls who Code to help girls develop technical knowledge at a young age.\n\n**Komal on empowering girls to make their own decisions **\n\n**Be it career or deciding what to eat, Komal firmly believes that girls should make their own choice. **\n\n*She feels that we need to empower girls to make decisions from a very young age. It can be a simple activity such as going to a restaurant and allowing them to order what they want. This helps boost their confidence.\"*\n\nKomal herself has 2 daughters. One is 10 years old and the other is 14 years old. She keeps telling her girls not to allow the world to define them. She feels girls should invest in themselves and now allow others to define their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n*If you wish to pursue a career in computers and Information technology, you can check out our *[*free online courses in Information Technology*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=information-technology)* *\n\n*Or you can *[*click here to get free career guidance about your dream career!*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options)\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Guidance, Career Options, Finance, Inspiring story, Female role model\n\n",

An ill father. A poor, illiterate mother. And no money for education. But nothing stopped Wasima. First, she topped SSC. And then MPSC…And became the deputy collector of Nagpur!\n\n## Here is the inspiring story of this girl who changed her fortune and the fortune of her entire family!\n\n### A difficult childhood\n\nBorn in Nanded, Wasima had to face a lot of problems. Her father could not work because he was ill. Her mother was a labourer. The money she earned was not enough to make ends meet.\n\nIn addition, Wasima’s village was well known for child marriages, alcohol addiction, illiteracy, and domestic violence.\n\n*It isn't easy to stay positive in challenging situations.

Wasima’s child marriage would mean less burden on the family. But Wasima wanted to study ahead.\n\nAs a child, Wasima’s mother was forced to quit her education and get married. She did not want the same fate for Wasima.\n\nShe wanted her daughter to fulfill her. Complete her education and stand on her own feet.\n\nWasima took up the challenge and topped the SSC exam.\n\nThen she went on to graduate in Arts from Yashwant Rao Chavan Maharashtra Open University.\n\nThis was a proud moment for Wasima’s mother – who did not even study till the 5th standard!\n\nWasima had bigger dreams than just graduation. She wanted to give her MPSC exams.\n\nThis is where she received unconditional support from her brother…\n\nWasima’s brother quit his studies and drove an auto-rickshaw to pay her fees for the MPSC exam\n\nWasima’s elder brother, Imran, was in college when Wasima started studying for MPSC exams.\n\nThen they came to know to support Wasima’s education, they would need money for her coaching classes and other requirements.Imran dropped out of his BSc and started driving an auto-rickshaw to support his sister.This helped Wasima to arrange study material for herself.But were more problems - no electricity, rising costs of her tuitions and the additional money needed for\n\nWasima did not believe in excuses. She even studied without electricity. Her only goal was to work hard. She wanted to change her and her family’s life for good.For the first six months, she joined coaching classes to study the exam pattern. But later, she studied on her own.\n\n“There are only two ways to face problems—drown in them and look for escapism or improve your circumstances. I chose the latter as my mother and brother extended unconditional support,” Wasima once said.\n\n### Try. Try. Till Success\n\nWasima cleared MPSC written exams in the first attempt but failed in the interview. Wasima, however, refused to give up.\n\nFailing at the interview stage was a big blow to Wasima’s family because they didn’t have enough money to invest in one more year of preparation.\n\nHer mother was again pressured by her relatives to get her daughter married. But nothing could stand before Wasima’s willpower and hard work.\n\nWhile she did not crack MPSC, she was still selected as a grade two officer in Nagpur’s sales tax department. She took up this job. Simultaneously she also prepared for her civil service exams.\n\nWith consistent efforts and determination, she topped the exam and secured the third rank in MPSC. Today, she is a proud deputy collector in Maharashtra.\n\nShe is also a sister any brother would be proud of. After getting a job, Wasima also helped her brother complete his education.\n\nShe is also a daughter any mother would be proud to have. While her mother could not study beyond standard 5, she ensured that her daughter fulfilled her dream.\n\nThere are so many girls like Wasima who have lots of beautiful dreams and goals for their future.

But is this true? No! Women can work in Merchant Navy too.\n\nWhat is Merchant Navy?\n\nAbout 90% of goods are transported around the world via ships. This commercial shipping field is known as the Merchant Navy. The job requires you to be at sea most of the time. However, the salary is incredibly high.\n\nThere are three departments in the Merchant Navy:\n\n1. Deck\n2. Engine\n3. Catering/Galley\n\nAll three departments are ranked in two categories - officers and crew. Currently, there is no female crew in the Indian merchant navy. The officer category is a better choice for women due to working and living conditions.\n\n## Let's talk about the officer rank in each of the departments mentioned above:\n\n1. **Officer in the Deck department: **\n\nA deck officer is also called a Navigation Officer. They are crucial to the ship's management team. The officers are in charge of the entire ship full of valuable cargo.\n\nA deck officer on duty/watch needs to make decisions regarding the ship's journey. This includes steering, navigation and communication using the latest technology.\n\nSenior officers will have a team under them. The topmost rank is that of a master/captain.\n\nOfficers in the deck department earn an average salary of 8 Lakhs per year (₹66.7k per month). This can go up to 20 lakhs per year.\n\n1. **Engine-department Officer:**\n\nAn engine officer is an engineer on board. This job needs a lot of physical work. Engine offices are responsible for maintaining and operating machinery on ships, both in the engine room and on deck. You can usually see engine officers wearing boiler suits when on the ship.\n\nA mechanical engineer's salary in Merchant Navy ranges from ₹ 1.8 Lakhs to ₹ 11.5 Lakhs.\n\n1. **Catering/ Galley department officers: **\n\nThese officers are responsible for cleaning the ship's alleyways, messrooms, common rooms, etc. They are also in charge of food storage and preparation. They plan meals in advance, order and store the required ingredients and cook them for the staff on board.\n\nA Catering Officer's salary in India ranges from ₹0.4 Lakhs to ₹12.1 Lakhs, with an average annual wage of ₹ 3.1 Lakhs.\n\nWomen on board merchant navy ships have their own cabins with an attached washroom. Hence, the accommodation and job are totally safe. There are no issues in terms of privacy. Women are respected and treated equally.\n\nEven after retiring from the ship, there are a vast number of career options for women on land if they wish to remain with their families. This includes teaching, being an author, managing ship operations from land, etc. They can even board ships to guide them to port, which is a day's work or two.\n\nDoes this career option excite you?

The exam is conducted in two phases, and Paper I of the JHT exam is scheduled to be conducted on 26th Nov 2019.\n\n## With the exam nearing its scheduled date, here are some last-minute preparation tips for all candidates:\n\n1. Firstly, you need to know that Paper I is an online test consisting of general Hindi and English questions lasting for 2 hours. Each section consists of 100 questions and is of 100 marks each. Each correct answer carries 1 mark and each wrong answer carries a penalty of 0.25. So, if you are less than one month away from the exam, make sure you focus on the language you are stronger in, in this case, either English or Hindi.\n2. The syllabus in Hindi consists of the following topics: Grammatical Topics i.e. Samas, Sandhi, Kriya, Visheshan, etc., Hindi Synonyms, Hindi Paragraphs, Hindi Proverbs, Hindi Antonyms, Hindi Spellings (vartani). So, make use of the time that you have in hand to brush up your grammar skills in Hindi.

There are around 2,45,000 vacancies in various job roles in the railways this year, and this is a great opportunity for aspirants to grab. If you are preparing for one of the railway exams that are almost around the corner, like the JE (Junior Engineer) exam which will be held tentatively in April/ May, then it’s time you change gears and start doing very serious preparation. Here are a few last minute tips that can be made use of in all railway examinations:\n\n1. Go through the entire syllabus and pattern of the exam you are going to take in order to create a proper plan in the limited time you have. Generally, most railway exams have the following 4 sections: Mathematics/ Quantitative Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, General Science and General Awareness. Understand thoroughly the portions that come under each topic and come up with a study plan.\n\n2. Have a subject-wise strategy in place. Every subject demands a different kind of approach and in the last few days before the actual exam, you need to strike the right chord, so that you don’t waste time. Figure out the important topics that need to be focussed on under each subject. Here are some of the important topics in each section:\n\n**Mathematics**: Percentage, Ratio and Proportion, BODMAS, Compound Interest and Simple Interest, Time and Work, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry\n\n**Logical Reasoning**: Blood Relation, Direction, Analytical Reasoning, Analogy, Statement Argument, Assumption, Classification, Syllogism\n\n**General Science**: Classification, Life Processes, Ecology, Sources of Energy, Reproduction, Acid, Bases and Salts, Metals and Non-Metals, Chemical Reactions, Units and Measurement, Heat, Force, Electricity and Magnetism, Gravitation\n\n**General Awareness:** Keep yourself abreast with the current affairs, watch informational videos, read PDFs and the newspaper every day.

Competitive exams like these are all about speed and accuracy. With the enormous number of people taking these exams every year, the slightest difference in accuracy and speed can make a lot of difference. So, practice[ online railway mock tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-tests/railways) every day to feel confident by the day of the exam.\n\n4. While giving your mock exams, make sure that you don’t linger on to a single question and waste time. Make sure to spend a maximum of 1-2 minutes on a question and if you still can’t crack it, move on to the next one. Later, once the entire exam is done, go back to the difficult questions and try cracking them.\n\n5. Last minute study tip for Mathematics: Start with the less difficult lessons including LCM, HCF, Average, Percentage, Profit and Loss, Simple and Compound Interest, etc. Get all the formulae by heart and get a strong hold on these basics. Nest, go for the slightly more difficult portions like Simplification, Time and Work, Time, Distance and Speed, etc. and only after you feel comfortable with these go for the next set of difficult chapters like Statistics, Probability, Permutation, and Combination.\n\n6. Last minute study tip for Logical Reasoning: Go in the same order of difficulty as mentioned for Mathematics. Start with practicing Puzzles, Distance and Directions, Blood Relations, etc, then move towards Seating Arrangements, Coding-Decoding, Input-Output, Assertion and Reasoning, and the like.\n\n7. Last minute study tip for General Science: Refer your class 9 and class 10 Science textbooks and brush up all the concepts. Make quick notes of all the important formulae, definitions, processes, etc.\n\n8.

Some have taken the initiative independently and while others have used their position in official government positions. One such shining example is female IAS Officer and recently-retired Union Health Secretary, Preeti Sudan. Between June 2019 and July 2020, she served in her post and her time in the position had to deal with the outbreak of the ongoing pandemic. As part of her responsibilities, she led the way when it came to sharing key information with the entire country about the virus when little was known about it and it was just beginning to spread.\n\nFaced with a challenging situation, the ex-Health Secretary shouldered some very important responsibilities and was always leading from the front. Her job was three-pronged. First, she had to create a strategy to tackle the outbreak effectively and in coordination with the Prime Minister’s Office to ensure that the unavoidable outbreak of the virus would be contained as effectively as possible while minimizing the damage it would cause across the country. Looking at the number of cases that were reported within the first two months, it was clear that she had successfully dealt with the task at hand. For example, she created the zoning system which helped identify the level of infections within every area in each city. She also created protocols for restricted travel during the early days of the outbreak.\n\nAs more and more people joined the fight at the forefront against COVID-19, Preeti Sudan was one of the many inspirational women in India who were more than up for the challenge. She comforted the nation at a time when it was a delicate situation as migrant workers were heading back to their hometown and there was a mass exodus of people from bigger cities. Through regular and effective press briefing, she was not only able to give important and necessary updates to the entire country but also ease the fears of the people. Her calm and confident nature saw her deal with common and frequently asked questions comfortably and with positivity. If that is not the definition of a woman warrior, then what is?\n\nFinally, she used her position to ensure the containment of the outbreak within as small an area as possible within the states. She was continuously in touch with officers in every state who was in charge of dealing with the outbreak and she was very proactive in ensuring that all the departments were executing their tasks in the best way possible. As the Union Health Secretary, she used her powers to oversee the execution of such tasks personally for every state emerging as one of the key women leaders in our country. She acted as the first and most important point of contact for all disease-related queries that were directed at the government by both, the media and the general public.\n\nThe former Health Secretary has a very rich educational background. She holds a Master’s degree in Economic Philosophy and a doctorate in Economics from the prestigious London School of Economics. Her drive to serve the country saw her rise from the Andhra cadre as one of the early women IAS officers in the country. Her service to the nation saw her serve several positions including Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defence and a Special Secretary in the Ministry of Women and Child Development. One of her most recent positions was as a Secretary in the Department of Food and Public Distribution. She was also at the forefront of dealing with the Kerala floods in 2019 and her action drew her high praises from all sections of the government.\n\nThe story of former Health Secretary minister Preeti Sudan proves that the will of women in this country can move mountains.

In India, retail is the second-largest source of modern jobs after construction. If a career in the retail industry is something that interests you, then a personal grooming course is a great way to get started. Here's how the industry started and what you need to enter it.\n\nYou could say that people have been sharing, selling, bartering, exchanging, and consuming resources for nearly as long they have existed. Right from the Great Exhibition in 1851 inaugurated by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert held at the Crystal Palace, the industry has only grown. The palace housed consumer goods from around the world. Millions of people came to window shop and get a glimpse of modern design and technology which opened their eyes to what this new industrial world could offer.\n\nNow, from the United Kingdom to back home in India, post-liberalization, the economy opened up, and a new large middle class with spending power had emerged, which helped shape this industry. India has moved from the traditional terms of '*haat bazaars*' and '*Mandis*' to the globally accepted supermarkets.\n\nThe retail industry is set to grow very rapidly in the coming years as more and more Indians seek modern shopping experiences such as buying goods from malls and supermarkets \". With this expansion, comes a host of new job opportunities for women.\n\nDid you know? For over 70 percent of the most commonly sold products such as food, soap, shampoo, detergents, the person who makes the decision to purchase is a woman. All this time, the sellers have been mainly men but today, companies in retail realize that women don’t just know what to buy, they also deeply understand how to sell and manage retail outlets This is why it is becoming increasingly common to see women work as cashiers, sales assistants, and shop managers.\n\nSo, what are some important characteristics companies look for in hiring women for retail jobs? Companies in the retail sector such as Big Bazaar, Shoppers Stop, and D Mart are continuously trying to understand how to attract, engage, and retain customers. And to do so, it not only essential for their employees to have a pleasant personality but also to be well-groomed. Grooming is the process of making yourself presentable for work.

However, we are nowhere close to being the leading nation in terms of women in the workforce. We have not moved out of the ‘it’s a man’s world’ phase yet because job opportunities are generally concentrated in a few cities and localities and work hours are generally fixed. For many female students, it is very challenging to travel long distances late evenings after college to get work experience necessary for applying to jobs later on. For many women with families to look after, leaving the house and kids to work in an office for eight to nine hours in a day is an impossible task.\n\nNow, imagine if you didn't have to do that! Imagine, the couch in your home is the office chair, your travel to a corner in your living room, and your kitchen, being the office pantry. We're not saying this makes life more comfortable, but it could help make it a bit simpler to get to work. Here are 3 job opportunities that help women strike a balance between working and studying or any type of responsibility because they can all be done from home.\n\n## 1) Wonk Tutor\n\nIf teaching is your dream, then here’s how you can make it a reality starting today. Wonk is a platform that helps parents find tuition teachers, known as tutors, for their children. A Wonk tutor job involves teaching an individual or group of students virtually, at their home or your own home. You pick the subject you are an expert in, be it maths, a language, or even dance. The best part is, you can work as per your schedule and convenience.\n\n***Link*:** [https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/teaching-jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/teaching-jobs)\n\n## 2) Sheroes MARS\n\nSheroes Mars is a platform that helps connect women with work from home opportunities in the space of Customer Support and Telemarketing for larger companies.

We are here to tell you what you should do to become a successful photographer.\n\nThere are many different types of photographers: wedding photographers, fashion photographers, art photographers, newspaper photographers etc. Depending upon the type of photography that interests you, you will be working in or outside a studio. For example, fashion photographers work in a studio while wildlife photographers have to travel deep into the jungles.\n\nYou do not need an educational degree to become a photographer.

Just Get Started\n\nInvest in a good quality camera and start taking pictures. If you cannot purchase a brand new camera, you can always buy a second-hand camera or rent a camera on weekends. But, regularly taking pictures is necessary. Study your photos and make a note of the images you like. Ask yourself why you like a particular picture. What makes it better than the others?\n\n### 2.

Use this knowledge to take outstanding pictures.\n\n### 4. Master Lighting\n\nPhotography comes from two Greek words that together mean “drawing with light”. Great pictures come from great lighting. To get clients to hire you, you should know how to shoot a variety of styles using lighting effectively. A good photography course will help you master lighting.\n\n### 5. Seek Mentors\n\nSearch for the best photographers on Facebook and Instagram. Connect with them. Take their feedback on the pictures taken by you.

A noteworthy trend is the increasing role of women in steering the ship of data-driven marketing. This article explores how women excel in leveraging **market research**, **marketing analytics**, and **market research reports** to propel businesses forward.\n\n## The Power of Market Research:\n\nEffective marketing begins with deeply understanding the market, trends, and consumer behaviours. **Market research** is pivotal in unravelling these intricacies, providing businesses with valuable insights. In India, women are making significant contributions to this field, bringing their unique perspectives and analytical prowess to the forefront of strategic decision-making.\n\n### Marketing Analytics - Unveiling Patterns and Trends:\n\nAs technology advances, so does the need for businesses to harness the power of **marketing analytics**. This involves systematically analysing marketing data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. Women in marketing increasingly embrace the analytical side of their roles, employing data-driven approaches to optimise campaigns, enhance customer experiences, and drive business growth.\n\n### Market Research Reports - A Wealth of Insights:\n\n**Market research reports** are invaluable tools that distil extensive data into actionable business insights.

Their ability to derive meaningful conclusions from complex data sets contributes to the success of marketing campaigns.\n\n### The Rise of Women in Marketing:\n\nTraditionally, marketing has been perceived as a field dominated by men. However, the narrative is changing, and women increasingly take leadership roles in the industry. Their ability to blend creativity with data-driven decision-making sets them apart. The inclusive nature of marketing is evolving, recognising the vital contributions that women bring to the table.\n\n### Empowering Marketing Analysis:\n\n**Marketing analysis** involves thoroughly examining various factors that impact the success of marketing strategies. Women in marketing excel in this aspect by conducting in-depth analyses and integrating a holistic approach that considers cultural nuances and consumer behaviours specific to India. This nuanced understanding is critical for crafting campaigns that resonate with the diverse Indian audience.\n\n### Challenges and Triumphs:\n\nWhile women are making strides in data-driven marketing, challenges such as gender biases and stereotypes persist. However, the triumphs of women who have excelled in the field serve as inspiration. Initiatives promoting gender diversity, mentorship programs, and skill-building opportunities are helping bridge the gap and create a more inclusive environment for women in marketing.\n\n### The Future of Data-Driven Marketing:\n\nAs India embraces the era of data-driven decision-making, the future of marketing is undeniably intertwined with analytics. With their dual prowess in creative thinking and analytical skills, women are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping this future. The evolving landscape presents many opportunities for women in marketing to continue making substantial contributions.\n\nThe synergy between **market research**, **marketing analytics**, and the prowess of women in marketing is steering the industry towards new horizons in India. The ability of women to excel in data-driven marketing is reshaping strategies, campaigns, and the overall approach to connecting with consumers.

She then had two sons and got busy taking care of kids and family.\n\nShe was creative, though and took up dress designing as a hobby. Then it became a source of pocket money for her. Starting a business was never her plan, though.\n\nShe says, “When I started designing clothes as a hobby to earn some pocket money, I never dreamt of becoming a businesswoman!”\n\nHowever, she had courage and passion. “If you have the passion for something, just do it,” she says. And that’s exactly what she did!\n\nShe took up a loan of Rs 8000 and launched the brand BIBA, a brand specializing in salwar kameez and kurtas.\n\nIn 2004, Biba opened its first outlet in a Mumbai mall.

One needs a business degree to start a business: **Meena had no earlier experience of running a business or working in a corporate set-up when she started designing clothes.\n\nIn fact, Meena was a self-taught designer. She had no formal degree in either dress designing or business. It was her determination, passion, hard work and creativity all the way.\n\n- **You need to be wealthy to start your own business or be a part of a business family:**** **Meena's husband was in the Navy. She took a loan to start her business.\n- **Girls need to stick to conventions. And not think beyond: **Meena followed an opposite route, in fact. Rather than limit her talent as a hobby, Meena decided to expand her horizons. She ventured out to start her business at an age where people start planning for retirement. It was this approach of expanding her horizon and thinking beyond what is the convention that helped Meera achieve success!\n\nWhen Meena started her business, she had to learn everything on her own.

Seeing her mother work through day and night to provide for the family, she decided to aim for something big and went to Harvard for her education at the age of 22.\n\nThe journey from Chennai to Harvard was again not easy because she did not have enough money and went on a student loan. Her sole purpose of education was centered around providing security to her family by getting a job. Unlike other students, she could not afford to take trips or enjoy, due to the pressure to pay back the loan.\n\nThe learnings of the university and her willpower to do something big in the field of finance made her secure a position in the male-dominant world of the corporate hierarchy. Securing a position after sincere determination is one thing, but she was also successful in improving the financial performance of the company through her understanding of the industry and numbers.\n\n### She was called a ‘Transformational Leader’ by the CEO of General Motors, who is also a female.\n\nGuess what? Divya was no different than a regular girl.

The Evolving Role of Women in Healthcare\n\nTraditionally, women in healthcare were often associated with nursing and caregiving roles. However, the narrative is changing. Women are not only caregivers but are actively contributing to healthcare policies, research, and advocacy. Nowhere is this more evident than in the field of mental health.\n\n### 2. Mental Health Advocacy: Breaking the Silence\n\n**Mental health advocacy** in India has historically faced challenges due to societal stigma and a lack of awareness. Women are playing a pivotal role in breaking the silence surrounding mental health. Through open conversations, awareness campaigns, and support networks, they are challenging the stereotypes and creating a more compassionate understanding of mental health issues.\n\n### 3. Women in Mental Health Professions\n\nThe inclusion of women in mental health professions is on the rise. From psychologists to psychiatrists, women are actively pursuing roles that involve diagnosis, treatment, and support for individuals facing mental health challenges. Their empathetic approach and ability to create safe spaces contribute significantly to healing.\n\n![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/Healthcare%201.jpg) *[776x517]*\n\n### 4.

These courses equip women with the knowledge and skills required to address the complexities of mental health. The increasing number of women pursuing these courses indicates a positive transformation in the healthcare sector.\n\n### 5. Online Courses: Accessibility and Flexibility\n\nIn the digital age, the accessibility of education is a game-changer. Many women opt for **medical billing and coding online courses**, allowing them to balance their education with other responsibilities. These online courses provide flexibility and open doors for women to specialize in crucial areas of healthcare administration.\n\n### 6. Advocacy Beyond Clinical Roles\n\nWomen in mental health advocacy go beyond clinical roles. They actively participate in community outreach programs, educational initiatives, and awareness campaigns. Their efforts extend to destigmatising mental health issues at a societal level, ensuring that conversations around mental well-being become a norm rather than an exception. \n\n\n\n![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/Healthcare%202.jpg) *[778x1167]*\n\n### 7. Holistic Approach to Healthcare\n\nIncluding women in mental health advocacy brings a holistic perspective to healthcare. Women are known for their ability to empathize and understand the multifaceted nature of mental health challenges. Their inclusive and compassionate approach contributes to a more patient-centric and empathetic healthcare system.\n\n### 8. Inspiring Future Generations\n\nAs women make strides in mental health advocacy, they inspire future generations. They create a legacy of compassionate healthcare professionals by actively participating in mentorship programs and educational initiatives. Their influence extends beyond their immediate roles, shaping the future of mental health advocacy in India.\n\n**Women's empowerment in healthcare** is a positive and transformative force in the Indian context.

Many inspirational women are playing a critical role in pushing through the daily hardships and doing the best they can in the fight against the pandemic. One such person is Minal Dakhave Bhosle, Mylab Discovery Solution’s research and development chief. If you’re interested in the field of science and medicine, her story will inspire you to pursue a career in the field.\n\nMinal Bhosale and her team at Mylab created India’s first coronavirus test kit. The kit was manufactured in a short time of just six weeks compared to the industry standard of three to four months. Yet the most remarkable thing about the creation of the kit is that it all happened while she was pregnant. On March 18, she submitted her testing kit for evaluation to the National Institute of Virology. The same evening, she also submitted the kit to the Indian FDA and the drugs control authority CDSCO for commercial approval, just an hour before she went to a hospital to deliver her baby!\n\nShe is quoted saying, \"If you carry out 10 tests on the same sample, all 10 results should be the same. And we achieved that. Our kit was perfect.\" Minal and her team had only begun work on the testing kit in February after she left the hospital with a pregnancy complication. \"It was an emergency, so I took this on as a challenge. I have to serve my nation,\" she said, also mentioning that her team, which consisted of 10 members, worked tirelessly to ensure a quick turnaround.\n\nWomen like Minal are an excellent example of successful women in India who are driven and do not sit on their past success. During the 2009 outbreak of the Swine Flu disease, Minal was also part of the team working on a vaccine for the disease at NIV, Pune. Her efforts show us that women in science and technology in the country are carrying out some of the most pioneering work. Every kit manufactured by Mylab is capable of testing 100 samples at a cost of only Rupees 1,200. This is almost a quarter of the Rupees 4,500 India was paying to import COVID 19 testing from overseas. Minal and her team also made sure that the test diagnosis was available much quicker. The kit gives a diagnosis in two and a half hours compared to imported testing kits, which take up to seven hours.\n\nWomen warriors like Minal are the flag bearers for working women who are ambitious and fearless.

It is always good to have contacts that you can rely on in a new place.\n\n### Treat it as an opportunity\n\nRather than getting nervous about the new environment, take it as an opportunity to explore and learn new things.

Talk to people who stay next to your house as they are the ones who can be depended upon for any urgencies in the future.\n\n### Discover things that interest you\n\nCities are usually places where you will easily find numerous things that interest you and are related to your hobbies. Be it a dance class, a cooking class, a reading session, sports clubs or anything like that, find things that keep you connected with people and keep you engaged.\n\n### Keep pieces from home\n\nIf you are a very homesick person, then you can bring souvenirs from your home or your town that help you stay connected with the place.

The sight of these will keep you happy.\n\n### Stay motivated\n\nAt a new place, far away from your hometown, it can get difficult to stay motivated and brave at all times.

It was a small village, so the news spread like a fire and everyone came to know about her progress.\n\n## A day that changed everything\n\nHer ashamed parents, not so happy with their daughter’s decision, offered her a monthly help of Rs.500. In return, they asked her to leave the job. But she could not let anyone stand beyond her self respect. She denied. “If I financially depend on someone, they will have control over my life”, she said.\n\nSociety accused her of being ‘shameless’, but she didn’t bother because she had something big planned for herself.\n\nOne fine day, SUTRA sent her to Rajasthan to attend widows meet. This march aimed to go to the chief minister’s house and ask for the rights of single or widows. She was amazed to see women like her wearing colourful clothes and jewellery.\n\nBy staying amongst the women having the same sufferings as her, she was very discomforted. She noticed that be it of any region; women have to suffer unnecessarily.\n\n### The rise of Ekal Nari Shakti Sanghatan.\n\nAfter returning from Rajasthan, she decided to keep a similar meet of widowed women from her locality. Nirmal was indeed a woman who always helped others. After that, she collaborated with various NGOs.\n\nAround 120 widowed women gathered at the SUTRA premises. They did a silent protest by applying sindoor and bindis.\n\nNirmal and these women discussed a variety of topics. Like how to lodge an FIR, self-help groups to start small businesses, etc. She then named this organization *Ekal Nari Shakti Sangathan. *She also created a WhatsApp group that shared job vacancies. Later more and more women from various districts joined this group.\n\nNirmal did not stop there; she wanted to secure the lives of all the women in her organization.\n\nShe further went on a foot march to Shimla at the CM house and presented her 25 point plan. This plan included demands for land, income, jobs, pension, seats in elections, etc. Out of which, health insurance, ration cards for single women, and social security were implemented in the whole state. Women from age 19-90 years were all benefited from this gigantic move by Nirmal.\n\nThe Nirmal who was made to sit in a dim-lit room and blamed for killing her husband made the following progress for other widows like her:\n\n- Pension increased from rs.200 to RS. 300 for windows\n- Single women got their ration cards.\n- Health check-ups up to rs.5,00,000 were free for single women.\n- Educational funds increased under Mother Terresa Asahaya Matri Sambhal Yojana.\n\nThere are also many [scholarship programmes on Glow and Lovely Careers website](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/scholarship-for-women) for women. You can choose any scholarship that suits your educational need!Nirmal and her organization have been successful in breaking the stereotype. But yet they still face accusations and hatred from society. But none of these is going to stop her. Nirmal is 56 at present, but her heart is still 23. Giving land rights to women is her next goal. The Ekal Nari is never going to give up!\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Resume Builder, Inspirational Women in India, Inspiring Story, Online resume maker, online resume builder\n\n",

If you think you have to be an excellent athlete to work in the sports industry, you are wrong. If you've ever wanted to work in non-athletic sports.\n\n## These 7 options could be good for you:\n\n1. **Coach:** Coaches work with players to make sure they are ready for upcoming games. They teach the players the game's rules, get them to be good sports and take responsibility, and improve their skills through regular practice. They also guide the team in different ways to win matches. A lot of teachers want to find new talent. Most coaches start their careers as assistants to the head coach. Once they have enough experience, they can coach on their own.\n2. **Sports Therapist:** Athletes can get hurt before, during, or after a game. Sports therapists work with them to help prevent injuries, find, manage, and treat them when they happen, and get back to full fitness. They are responsible for figuring out how fit the players are and suggesting things to do before the game. They advise players on what to eat and how to stay healthy. Sports therapists can work in sports clinics or with a particular team or athlete.\n3. **Referee:** Referees and umpires work at sporting events, games, and competitions to keep the game's rules in place and ensure they are followed. They'll keep an eye on the time, keep track of the score, and deduct penalties. They'll also check the equipment to ensure it meets the game's safety rules. Most of the time, they work for schools or professional sports leagues.\n4. **Sports Journalist:** Sports journalists go to news conferences, one-day games, tournaments, and other events, do in-depth research and talk to people. They write articles that appear in newspapers and sports magazines. A sub-career is a sports photojournalist who takes pictures and records live videos of games, both during and after the game.\n5. **Sports Event Coordinator:** A sports event coordinator works closely with their teams to ensure that every detail is taken care of. Coordinators make sure the team has a place to stay and a way to get around. They also ensure that players and spectators are safe, check the venue, and organise important events like conferences, product launches, exhibits, etc. Event planners must plan every part of the event carefully, so they don't waste money.\n6. **Contract negotiator:** Contract negotiators are like middlemen who help athletes and teams or sports organisations come to fair agreements. They make sure that the agreements between the two parties are kept, and if there is a disagreement about the contracts, they can talk about it.\n7. **Exercise physiologist:** Exercise physiologists make training plans for athletes that consider the athlete's body, routine, and any known injuries to improve their performance, fitness level, strength, and flexibility. They also help athletes avoid injuries or heal ones that have already happened. Exercise physiologists and designers of sports equipment may work together to make equipment.\n\nDo you think any of these non-athletic sports careers fit you?

Anything is possible if you dream big, and Pratiksha's story shows you just that. Pratiksha was only a sweeper at a bank, but she dared to dream. She is now an Assistant General Manager at the same bank where she worked as a sweeper.\n\n## Here's her story. We hope it can inspire you always to pursue your dreams and work hard to achieve them.\n\nPratiksha didn't have an easy life. Her parents had her married off at the age of 17 due to financial troubles. She hadn't even completed her 10th grade. Her husband, Sadashiv Kadu, was a bookbinder at a Mumbai State Bank of India branch. Unfortunately, right after the birth of her son, she lost her husband in an accident. This changed her life forever. She now had an infant to take care of and no one to provide for her. She had to work to earn money for expenses. However, with the education that she had, finding employment was difficult. So she asked the bank where her late husband worked to help her with a job so she could survive.\n\nShe soon started a job at SBI as a sweeper. She made around 60-65 INR in a month. For this amount, she would clean the restrooms, dust the furniture, and sweep the branch's property for two hours in the morning. Her remaining time was spent caring for her son and managing the house. She also worked menial jobs for extra income.\n\nShe worked hard, but when she looked at the people around her with better-paying jobs, she decided that's where she wanted to be. She needed to improve her economic condition if she had to survive. Instead of complaining about the daily grind, she worked her current jobs and pursued her education at the same time.\n\nHer first step was passing the 10th grade. She aimed to give the banking exam, which required a minimum qualification of 10+2. With help from friends and relatives, she managed to buy supplies like books. She gained admission into a night college and passed her class 12th exams. She even earned a degree in Psychology much later.\n\nIn 1993, Pratiksha married a bank messenger, Pramod Tondwalkar, who encouraged her every step of the way. She had two children with him. She was promoted to the post of clerk in the bank. Her husband helped out with house chores and child care. Soon Pratiksha was promoted to the position of trainee officer. But she didn't stop there. Her financial condition improved. She worked hard and rose through many posts over the course of 18 years. Finally, she earned the title of SBI's Assistant General Manager.\n\nLast year, she earned a degree in Naturopathy and is now looking to make a career post her retirement at SBI. She is happy and enjoys working. Pratiksha is truly an inspiration. She fought against all odds and came out as a winner. Just like her, you can be what you want to be too!

Well, you've come to the right place. Read on to know what SEO is, how it works, why it's so important, and if the field is right for you.\n\nIn simple terms, SEO is using various methods to get more people to see a particular website or page online without paying them. However, this is a fast-paced job. There are constantly new ways, so it is important to be aware and keep learning. First, let's talk about the basics of SEO which include three things:\n\n1. Understanding how search engines work\n2. Research and Analysis\n3. Website Optimization\n\n## How do Search Engines Work?\n\nImagine this - The house you are in is covered with webs full of spiders. You are in 1 room looking for certain information. The spider in that room will crawl through the web and connect with other spiders, eventually finding what you want.\n\nCan you picture it? This is exactly how search engines work! The house represents the internet/web. The rooms are the pages. The spiders are bots that crawl all over the web to find the content you want.\n\nBut there is so much content all over the internet, and going through all of them is time-consuming. All content is ranked on relevancy. This is where SEO comes in handy. It improves the rank of your page on the search engine list, so it comes up faster.\n\nCurrently, Google is the most popular search engine in the world. Ranking higher on google increases the number of clicks on your website. To get your website on google, first find your sitemap, a list of all pages on your website. Then create a free Google Search Console account and submit it.\n\n### Steps to great SEO:\n\n1. Set your website correctly with a good domain, web host, logical site and URL structure and most importantly, user friendly.\n2. Cover the four facets of SEO: Keyword Research, On-page SEO, Link Building, Technical SEO\n\n1. **Keyword Research:** This includes learning what your audience is looking for, the terms they use when searching for it and how often those terms are used.\n2. **On-page SEO:** Using the keywords found during research on your website will make it easier for the audience to find you. But that's not all - how and where you use the keywords is also essential - which means the content must be relevant and relatable to the audience. This includes a descriptive URL, a compelling title tag (clickable headings in the search results) and optimized images (compressed, well-named, and with alt. text.)\n3. **Link Building: **Other websites/pages lead to your website via links. These are like confidence builders for the audience. They see pages other than the website talking about the website. An excellent way to do this is by blogging on other sites. Find patterns in competitors strategies and use effective ones.\n4. **Technical SEO: **This is mainly helping your website get listed on search engines like google.\n\nNow that we covered the basics, you can check the success by measuring the increase in traffic using Google Analytics.\n\nBuild your free resume at the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation): [Online Resume Builder](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/free-online-resume-builder).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Resume Builder, online resume builder, Creative resume, Career Options, Online Career Guidance\n\n",

She is also the first bicycle mayor of Jaipur. She earned this title from a social enterprise based all the way in Amsterdam, Europe.\n\nShe started this journey in 2017 with just 9 cycles. With the hard work she put into nurturing her idea, Pink Pedals grew. Her offbeat business idea began to get attention. It also got featured in the Top 26 Startups in Rajasthan by Inc42, an Indian startup information platform.\n\nPink Pedals now has a fleet of more than 300 cycles and is one of the largest bike sharing and rental companies in Jaipur.\n\n### The Change In Path From Law To Bicycles\n\nPooja Vijay is a BCom graduate with an LLB degree. Before Pink Pedals, she worked for corporate companies like Infosys and Genpact.\n\nBicycling was just a hobby that she enjoyed. But this changed when she heard about the rise of pollution in Delhi.\n\nShe felt that Jaipur, her home city, could be in the same state of pollution anytime soon. To her, Jaipur is home, the city that gave her everything. She wanted to do something to help her city and the environment.\n\nThe solution that then came to her mind were bicycles! That’s how she went on this new journey.\n\nIn the start, people wondered why she was quitting a law career to take on a very unusual business path, but Pooja knew herself. She knew this is what she wanted to do.\n\n**- - - - -**\n\nPooja changed her career path from a corporate role to cycling. It is a slightly risky decision, but she felt confident about it.\n\nIf you also want to step into something new but don’t feel 100% positive about it, try taking a [career test.](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance)\n\nThrough the test, you’ll discover where your skills and interests lie. This will then help you decide whether a new career path is an advisable decision or not.\n\n**- - - - -**\n\n### How Pooja Executed This Fabulous Idea To Rent Bicycles\n\nThe idea started with 9 cycles. In the beginning, she placed it at Jawahar Circle, a popular park in Jaipur. Initially, very few rented the cycles.\n\nBut Pooja was determined to pursue this idea. She now had to think of new ways to attract people.\n\nSo she kept different bicycles for all age groups. For small kids with supportive side wheels and comfortable ones for elderly customers.\n\nAfter that, she suggested people cycle and see the rich heritage of Jaipur instead of getting stuck in traffic. This attracted tourists.\n\nShe also installed bicycle stations in Mahindra World City, a part of Jaipur, where all the big corporate companies are located. This way, she made corporate employees interested in cycling to work.\n\nShe didn’t hold back but went ahead with all the creative ideas she had, and eventually, this got her success!\n\nPink Pedals is now 4 years old and, on a mission, to make cycling a habit to stay fit, healthy, and happy.\n\n### How Did Pooja Vijay Achieve Success?\n\nShe Turned Her Hobby Into A Career - Cycling was a hobby for Pooja, but she made a business out of it. It was an unusual path, but she was confident about handling it.\n\nShe Knew Herself Well - Making a living out of any hobby, be it cycling like Pooja, or something like designing or even cooking, requires you to know yourself thoroughly. [Taking internships](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/internships) or [career tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) are some common ways to become aware of your individual strengths.\n\nPooja Thought Differently - For her startup idea to achieve success, she thought in a very unique way. She saw that her city lacked a culture of cycling and she wanted people to be eco-friendly. Her ability to think differently shaped her success.\n\nIf you also have a strong startup idea, then believe in your vision and build the idea with your passion just like Pooja did.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Guidance, Online Career Test, Online Career Guidance, Career test online, Online Tests\n\n",

Our mind plays an important role, and here's where good personality development comes into the picture. It helps change your thoughts, beliefs, and attitude to excel in your career.

In the case of Hindi Editor Poonam Pandey, that is exactly the case. When Poonam started studying journalism, she hardly imagined that it was the first step to her becoming a Hindi Editor one day.\n\nPoonam came from the city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai, with the aim of fulfilling her career hopes and dreams. “I’m originally from Agra, but I have been living in Mumbai for the last five years.” Poonam took up a journalism course at Mumbai University and was looking to make a mark in the field. But being from a conservative family, her parents were not particularly keen on letting her pursue a career in journalism. Just like many conventional parents, Poonam’s parents too thought that it was a tough field for a woman to choose and excel in.\n\nBeing very passionate about writing has always been the case for Poonam. “When I was a young girl, I always knew where my passions lay. I wrote stories and poems even as a child so I was aware that I possessed some skill in this space.” Just like a lot of girls even today, she knew pursuing her dreams would not be easy and she would have to prove she deserved a chance to pursue her dreams.\n\n“I was always looking online for a chance to add to my education. One day while looking at journalism courses I stumbled upon an online course on content writing.” Her parents were not going to allow her to go and join a writing course in another city, so she enrolled and completed her course in content writing online itself.\n\nSeeing her dedication and drive, her parents supported her in pursuing her dreams and she was able to secure a job as a Junior Writer. One thing led to another and the rest is history. Poonam is now a Hindi Editor and writes for Hindustan Unilever’s online housekeeping solutions platform Cleanipedia. By refusing to accept conventional career options for girls from smaller towns, Poonam chose to persist with her dreams and wrote a powerful story about women empowerment.\n\nIf you want to read and be inspired by more such stories, you can find them on the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) Career Foundation website under the Success Stories section (click [here](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/students-success-stories)).

Present the essay in the right format\n\nFollow this essay format outline:\n\n- Introduction\n- Background / History related\n- Main concept/theory/ what the subject is about\n- Current scenario related to it.\n- Positive aspects\n- Negative aspects/obstacles\n- Suggested reforms\n- Conclusion\n\n2.

Don’t deviate too much away from the topic.\n\n5. Maintain a neutral tone throughout your essay.\n\n### General tips to follow while preparing for the SSC JHT exam:\n\n1. Understand the syllabus in and out. Do not skip any topic while preparing.\n\n2. Focus on your weaker areas to make them stronger. However, do not make the mistake of leaving out any topic during preparation thinking that you are strong with it. This might cost you during the exam.\n\n3. Make a time-table in detail about how you are going to prepare and stick to it.\n\n4. Have a target to finish studying the entire syllabus at least 3-4 months before the exam.\n\n5. Solve as many practice mock tests and online mock tests as possible during preparation.\n\n6. Solve previous years’ question papers form at least 10 years\n\n7.

But things get really surprising when you look at this gender ratio in workplaces. The workforce of India is highly male-dominated. This gap in gender representation gets wider as you start observing the leadership teams. And this fact mostly holds irrespective of whether the company is a small one or a big one.\n\nUp until very recently, women were limited to doing domestic work. This practice owes its existence to various reasons, from the fact that people generally see women as weak to the male ego unable to handle a woman's success. While several women stood up against this patriarchy, only a few succeeded. As a result, we can almost count the number of female business leaders altogether at our fingertips.\n\nThis story is about one such fierce woman who showed the world that women are second to none when they set their minds on something. We are talking about none other than the chairperson of Park Hotels, Miss Priya Paul.\n\n### Who is Miss Priya Paul?\n\nPriya started her career in her father's company.\n\nWhen her father passed, she had to shoulder the burden of his business. She had to manage three hotels owned by her father's group. She lacked the experience of running a hotel business. Still, she overcame all challenges with a determined attitude and hard work. They say behind every successful man there is a woman. Something similar is true in the case of Priyal Paul too. Her mother and some other female family members have helped Priya along the way. As a matter of fact, her mother handled the hotel business for a good ten years. But Priya wasn't one to follow any guidebooks handed to her. Instead, she went with what her gut told her and paved her way to success with her authenticity.\n\n### Miss Priya Paul's Success\n\nWhile many doubted her, her success proved her mettle. She increased her father's hotel business by 400%. She added nine more hotels to the group. Today there are 12 Park Hotels across nine cities in India.

It connects potential employees to companies looking to hire. The networking site has a lot of advantages and can prove to be beneficial career-wise. Almost every working person uses it. Hence, you can connect to leading people in your industry. The site is a very effective tool for marketing oneself.\n\nWhat does marketing oneself mean? Simply put, it is a way to promote yourself. This is done by highlighting education and achievements and generally showing employers what you can do. This means that people become aware of who you are and the kind of work you do. Marketing yourself also helps people realise whether you are a good fit for their company.\n\nSo if you don't have a LinkedIn profile yet, create one today! If you do, here's how you can effectively use it to promote yourself to prospective employers.\n\n- First, you need to appear on search lists of employers and hiring agents. The key to using LinkedIn in the best way possible is to ensure you're 'discoverable' to agencies and employers. Updating your location helps recruiters know where you are based. It also allows you to narrow down places of work.\n- Once a hiring manager or a recruiter checks out your profile, what will they see? Remember, your LinkedIn profile is their first impression of you. HRs don't only check if you are interested in being hired. They look at your profile picture. They check your posts and interactions. They even check posts and images that you are tagged on. This helps give them an idea of the person you are. Ensure that your profile picture is clear and professional. It needs to be appealing to see and not taken in an inappropriate setting or a dimly lit room with a messy background. Not only your profile picture but even your cover photo also needs to be aesthetic. It could be anything, even a simple background.\n- Update your bio! Keep it short and sweet. Mention what you do and what you are looking for. Think of it as marketing yourself using three sentences.\n- Ensure your education, accomplishments and work history is up-to-date. Write only important points, so it isn't too cluttered. The HR needs only to see the key points. Too much information can make it looks messy and unorganised.\n- It is essential that you use all your connections to your advantage. Connect with people from the same industry. Connect with coworkers and friends. It will help you come across as well-connected and with a friendly personality.\n- Mention your previous jobs. Add the company you worked at and the work you did for them. This also increases your discoverability. Plus, it helps recruiters see what you are experienced at.\n- You can also share posts about your accomplishments in the company. Show that you value your company by sharing company posts, blogs and articles.\n- Share a few posts that talk about you in particular. It could be about your aim in life. It could be related to the work you do or your ideologies. This helps employees understand you.\n\nAdditionally, you can always endorse your peers and friends. They will likely endorse you as well. Recruiters check reviews and recommendations that you have left for companies and coworkers. The way you write these reviews is very important. Avoid leaving negative reviews for previous workplaces on LinkedIn.\n\nNow that you know how to use LinkedIn effectively, go get that job!

There are different types of psychology jobs. A graduation degree in psychology will help you get started. But you will need to complete your masters to get a specialized job. For example, a clinical counsellor who treats patients with mental illness in hospitals has a master's degree in clinical psychology.\n\nOne should never confuse a Psychologist with a Psychiatrist. They are very different. A psychologist only uses talk therapy to treat his/her patients. A Psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medicines to his/her patients. To help you understand Psychology on a deeper level, we have started an online psychology course called, Introduction to Psychology. It is a thorough beginner's guide to help those interested in a career in psychology.\n\nBut, what are the qualities of a good psychologist? What is the life of a psychologist like? What are the challenges they face? We caught up with Eshita Mandal, a leading psychologist from Mumbai to give you more clarity. As a Psychologist, Eshita Mandal takes pride in being able to make a difference in people's lives by helping them overcome emotional and mental problems.\n\n## In this exclusive interview, she gives us a glimpse of the most common issues of modern India and much more.\n\n### How would you define a successful Psychologist?\n\nA successful Psychologist is one who has a lot of patience and understanding of people. He/She should be able to actively listen to their client without making any kind of judgments. The field of psychology involves working with people; hence having good people skills is important.\n\n### What made you pick psychology as a career?\n\nDuring my time, we did not have any career guidance. The various subjects in the stream of Humanities that I studied in my junior college gave me some insight into my interests. Being a people-oriented person, I understood the theories and principles of psychology. Hence I chose to pursue psychology as a profession.\n\n### What are the biggest challenges you face as a Psychologist?\n\nChallenges are of various types. In our country, everyone thinks they are counsellors just by doing a crash course or some distance course. Many times they believe that advising is counselling. As a result, a qualified professional Psychologist does not get his due and recognition.\n\nOver the past few decades, the openness to meet Psychologist for counselling has increased, but there's still some discomfort in openly admitting to it.\n\n### How do you not let your client's emotional state affect you?\n\nIn my years of practice, I have learnt the art of leaving my client's stories to the clinic itself. I do not carry them with me outside.\n\n### What are the most common problems you have to treat?\n\nI often deal with relationship issues, children's behavioral issues and matters concerning the LGBTQ community.\n\n### What is the best thing about your job?\n\nThe best thing about my work is that in some way I am able to reach out to people and make a difference in their life through my counselling sessions. The trust, cooperation and confidence that my client's place in me is very gratifying.\n\n### How do you de-stress?\n\nFinding some Me-time and spending time with family and friends gives me a sense of satisfaction and pleasure.\n\n### What advice will you offer our readers about mental health?\n\nJust as we care about our physical fitness, it's important to treat our emotional traumas and fractures. Do not wait for the problem to settle down or push it under the carpet. It's always wise to seek professional help in addressing such issues. The earlier you address, the faster you'll bounce back.\n\n### If you could choose all over again, would you choose the same professional path?\n\nIn this life, Yes.\n\n### What would your advice young girls who aspire to become a Psychologist?\n\nGo ahead if you have identified that you have the skills and qualities of being a Psychologist. Don't choose the profession because you think its fun to read people's mind or because you like talking to people. It is much more than just talking!\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Options, Psychologist, Clinical Psychologist, online psychology course, Career in psychology\n\n",

Instead of following traditional career options such as engineering or medicine, Rashmi took a brave decision to become a writer instead. **\n\n**Today, Rashmi is an inspiration for so many girls who want to do something different and still be successful!**\n\nDoing what everyone does is a norm. Choosing an uncharted territory is what separates one from the herd. Makes one stand out. Look at Steve Jobs, for example. He did something different. He combined designing and arts with computers. And successfully launched Apple Computers.\n\nIf Steve Jobs had followed the herd, we wouldn't have heard about iPhones.\n\n## Very few attempt a field that is out of the blue. Rashmi Bansal is once such a personality.\n\nRashmi was an intelligent student. At that time, career choices were limited. Today we have many unconventional career options, such as being a content creator for YouTube or travel vlogger or food blogger. And these career options are easily accepted and encouraged by many people around us too. There are many [exciting jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs) available today. For girls and boys, men and women alike!\n\nWhen Rashmi started out, that was not the case. Choosing an unconventional, different and out of the box career was not encouraged. Career choices were limited as well. Either people chose to be an engineer or a Doctor or pursue some course from the USA.\n\nRashmi decided to do something completely different, though. When most of the girls around her were choosing typical careers, Rashmi decided to do something different.\n\n## Choosing Arts over Maths and MBA over Medicine\n\nThough young Rashmi was intelligent, like most students, she did not have a liking towards Mathematics. So, she pursued Arts and subsequently did her Bachelors in Economics.\n\nThis decision disappointed her acquaintances. An intelligent girl like her should have taken up a safer career option, is what everyone around her felt. But Rashmi was very convinced about her decision. So, she did not give in to the pressure around her and chose a subject she was interested in.\n\nHer decision to take up Arts and Economics proved to be correct when Rashmi got an admission for MBA from IIM Ahmedabad. Till then people believed that only engineers or those with commerce backgrounds were** **fit to be an MBA.\n\n**After finishing her MBA from the prestigious IIM Ahmedabad, Rashmi again decided to do something different. Rather than choose a job with a bank or a multinational company, Rashmi chose writing as her profession**\n\n**Choosing writing as a profession….**\n\nRashmi had a fascination with writing from her college days. After her MBA, she started her own publishing company JAM - Just Another Magazine. The magazine was very successful and popular with the youth.\n\nSoon Rashmi became very popular with the young college students. She understood the thoughts of the youth. She saw their dreams, aspirations, struggles and managed to connect with them through her writing.\n\nHer medium of communication is Hinglish (a combination of Hindi & English) which the current generation understands and relates to easily.\n\n**Becoming a successful writer and launching her own books **\n\nRashmi was always fascinated with stories of entrepreneurs – those who launched their own businesses. So Rashmi decided to write a book on start-ups in India.\n\n**Her first book was called – Stay Hungry and Stay Foolish. It covered the success stories of 25 entrepreneurs, who graduated from IIM Ahmedabad.**\n\n**The book was hugely successful and has sold more than 5,00,000 copies!**\n\nIt also started Rashmi's second career – writing books. **Today her books are translated into 12 languages across the globe.**\n\nRashmi's story is an inspiration to many to not follow the herd blindly. Life and career do not have a 'One-size-fits-all' approach. Choosing a career is subjective. If one is convinced about a career, stick to it dedicatedly.\n\nIf you are uncertain about the career, you wish to choose, going to a career counsellor for career guidance is a great option to consider.

But it can be difficult to make sense of the stock market if you’re a beginner. This is why before you invest, it’s good to consider expanding your basic knowledge on how the stock market works. To begin with, let’s understand the meaning of the stock market.\n\n## What is a stock market?\n\nA stock market is a marketplace where investors come to buy and sell shares in public companies listed on it. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are the two largest stock markets in India.\n\n*Why Investing In The Stock Market Is Becoming Popular These Days?*\n\nThere’s potential to build your money - Investing in the stock market is a good career option for young girls and women to smartly learn to grow money. You can then use those funds to invest in your own dreams, like opening your own business. But think of stocks as an option to do alongside completing your studies or doing a regular job.\n\nYou don’t need a large sum of money to start investing in the stock market - If you’re a student or a stay-at-home mom and don’t have large earnings, there’s no need to walk away from investing in stocks. You can still start by putting in small amounts like rupees 100, 200 or even 500. We’d also like to advise you that investing in stocks comes with risk; this is why it’s better to start investing in small amounts to avoid making huge losses.\n\nIt’s easily accessible - Having a degree in finance is always great, but there are many stock investors who do not have a degree but are still successful after learning. There are also plenty of online tools available that make investing in stocks fairly easy. To invest, you’d need a DEMAT account, and there are several online platforms that have made it simple to open this type of account.\n\n## Why Take A Stock Market Trading Course?\n\n### 1. You Learn The Difference Between Technical And Fundamental Analysis\n\nTwo terms that you’ll come across often when you invest in stocks are Fundamental and Technical Analysis.\n\n**Fundamental analysis** is about knowing the reputation of the company you’re going to buy a share in. If the company’s fundamentals are strong, then the stock price will be strong. Learning if the company is reliable and mature enough is something you can learn in a stock trading course.\n\n**Technical analysis** is about seeing data on how the company money is distributed and utilised. For this type of analysis, it’s necessary to learn the price patterns of the share of a company by studying charts. How to read different types of charts and what indicators to look for can be understood in a [fundamentals of technical analysis course.](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/edx-nyif+ita.pc1x/trading-fundamentals-of-technical-analysis)\n\n### 2. It Increases Your Knowledge On The Basics Of Trading\n\nIt is necessary to study the market and know which stock to buy and when. There are certain techniques that must be kept in mind to get a profit. There are many different types of indicators to look out for when investing in the stock market. You need to make predictions, but to do so you have to find patterns in the stock price. There are the types of things that you can learn in a stock market trading course.\n\n### 3.

The narrative shifts from a scarcity of **female pilots** to a surge in their presence, breaking stereotypes and forging a new path in the aviation industry.\n\nThe dream of a **career as a pilot** has historically been associated with a select few. However, the scenario is evolving, especially in India, where the skies witness an increasing number of women pursuing **pilot careers**. This paradigm shift is not merely a statistical change but a testament to the determination and passion of these women who have chosen to soar amidst the clouds.\n\nThe journey of **female pilots in India** reflects a departure from conventional norms. Historically, the cockpit was male-dominated, but now, women are making their mark as skilled and competent **commercial pilots**. The aviation industry in India has become more inclusive, acknowledging the prowess and capabilities of female aviators.\n\nOne of the contributing factors to the rise of **female pilots in India** is the increased awareness and encouragement for women to pursue careers in aviation. Organisations and training academies promote equal opportunities, ensuring aspiring female aviators receive the necessary support and mentorship to thrive in the industry.\n\nThe availability of **pilot jobs** and the growing demand for skilled professionals in the [aviation sector](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=aviation-and-aerospace) have further opened doors for women seeking a **career as a pilot**. Airlines actively recruit female pilots, recognising the diverse perspectives and strengths they bring to the cockpit. This shift is not just about gender inclusivity but also about tapping into a broader talent pool.\n\nThese trailblazing **female pilots'** stories inspire a new generation of aspiring aviators. One such trailblazer is Captain Ananya Singh, who, against all odds, pursued her dream of becoming a pilot. Her journey from dreaming of a **career as a pilot** to commanding a commercial aircraft showcases the determination and resilience of women breaking barriers in the Indian aviation landscape.\n\nThe societal perception of a **commercial pilot** is gradually changing, thanks to these women who have chosen to navigate the skies. Families and communities are becoming more accepting and supportive of women pursuing **pilot careers**. This shift in mindset is crucial for creating an environment where aspiring female pilots feel encouraged to pursue their passion without facing unnecessary societal barriers.\n\nThe rise of **female commercial pilots in India** is not just a trend; it is a transformative movement shaping the future of the aviation industry. Including more women in the cockpit enhances diversity, fosters innovation, and challenges preconceived notions about gender roles in traditionally male-dominated professions.\n\nThe ascent of **female commercial pilots** in India is a significant milestone in the aviation sector. As more women embrace a **career as pilots**, the skies become more inclusive and diverse. The narrative is evolving from a gender-specific career choice to a profession where talent and skill know no gender boundaries.

This is a company she started in the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of her daughters. Her business has no physical store but she manages it online on Instagram.\n\nIn a short time, her company has got nearly 19 thousand followers online.\n\n## Going Out Of Her Comfort Zone To Become A Financially Independent Housewife\n\nRitu was brought up in a time when society didn’t approve of girls working after marriage. This is why even though she had a postgraduate degree in commerce, she didn’t go out to look for a job but got married first.\n\nLike most Indian mothers, Ritu gave her daughters natural remedies for various skin-related problems that they complained about. From here began the idea to sell these homemade skin products and start a business. Her daughters also encouraged her to go ahead and create her company Everything Mom Made.\n\nWhen Ritu started Everything Mom Made, she had no background or knowledge about running a business online. It was something outside her comfort zone because for years she was a homemaker. Yet, she took on the challenge. At age 49, she created an opportunity for herself.\n\nShe now has a busy schedule, attends business phone calls and meetings. From being a housewife, she changed her role into a busy entrepreneur. With her earnings, she has the freedom to do as she likes with her finances.\n\n### Small Beginnings But Big Growth\n\nSocial Media has made it very easy to set up an online shop without the need to make a big investment. Like Ritu, you can make an account on apps like Instagram for free. Most small businesses use regular courier services to send their products to customers. You can directly chat and communicate with customers online and don’t need a real physical shop. There are many advantages to setting up an online store.\n\n### For Ritu to start Everything Mom Made, she invested only Rs 20,000 to begin her business.\n\nHer products started to receive a lot of love and attention from people that like to shop for homemade chemical-free skin products. Word of mouth also helped the small businessgrow. In addition, there is a huge demand in the market for organic items. This is why small local brands also get a lot of attention.\n\nIn an online interview, Ritu’s daughter mentions how her mom gets emotional every time a customer leaves a positive review about her product. Running her own business helps Ritu feel like she’s making an impact in society.\n\nHomemakers like Ritu have various options to go out and start earning for themselves. In the 90s, it was disapproved of by society when women worked after marriage. But it’s not the same anymore. Many women start businesses by themselves and are entering the workforce to be financially independent. There are many [internships](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/internships), work from home opportunities, and [exciting marketing jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/marketing-jobs) out there today.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Jobs for Women, Exciting Jobs, Opportunities for women\n\n",

And not someone who takes easily no for an answer.  Meet this inspiring girl who has aced everything – from sailing to medicine!.\n\n4 international medals. Around 30 gold medals. National gold medallist in sailing – every year for 8 years continuously. And multiple world championships – This pretty much sums Dr Rohini’s impressive sailing performance.\n\nAnd her list of achievements is not over yet…..\n\n- She is a public speaker. A theatre artist. A mother.\n- A medal winner in MBBS. The youngest doctor in Kauvery Hospital in Chennai.\n- And a health researcher on a National Geographic project !\n- She is also in the Top 50 achievers list of India Today…..The list just seems endless!\n\nIt will be easy to say that Rohini’s success story is one of the most [inspiring stories of Indian girls ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/students-success-stories) that we hear today.\n\n### Playing with the sea since she was a year old.\n\nRohini’s mother had studied Marine Biology. So her mother used to go boating and take baby Rohini along. That’s how Rohini developed a bond with the sea and sailing.\n\nWhen she was in class 12, she bagged her first-ever gold medal in an international competition. Rohini tried to manage both – her studies and her love for sailing.\n\n### But it was not easy…There was a time when Rohini failed!\n\nDuring her board exams, Rohini failed in Maths during the prelims exams. So, the college decided not to allow her to appear for board exams\n\nShe requested and pleased with the authorities and finally, she was allowed. Rohini then worked so hard that she **scored 86% in her exam. With just 3 months of studying!**\n\n### Sailing, Sports and Medicine: The winning combination\n\nMany people feel that Sports and Studies do not go well together. So students are usually told to concentrate only on one. It was no different for Rohini. Some expected her to sacrifice studies for sailing or studies for sailing. But once again, Rohini proved such a mentality wrong.\n\nAs a sports person, Rohini could apply for medicine through the sports quota. Eventually, her hard work did not go in vain. She got admission to a medical college with the help of her sports quota.\n\n### But now, she was expected to stop sailing to concentrate on medicine!\n\nRohini, however, was not in favour of this. Sailing had helped her get into a medical college, so it did not make sense to her to sacrifice that in favour of medicine. She decided to pursue both.\n\nShe took part in 7 sailing championships in her first year!\n\nBut handling both - medicine and sailing were not easy. Rohini used to travel a distance of 3 hrs from her college to practice sailing for her championships. But Rohini was determined to succeed.\n\nHer world championship clashed with her first-year final exams. So, her college dean encouraged her to go ahead with the tournament. Here too, Rohini turned out to be a winner! Not only did she win the championship, but she also became a doctor in due course – Proving to the world that nothing is complicated for a girl when she sets her eyes on it.\n\nThe most rewarding career is when one can follow one’s passion.

Sanjal Gavande\n\nWhen Sajal Gavande decided to take up mechanical engineering, some people around her were not confident. Few even thought: \"Why Mechanical Engineering? She's a girl. Will she be able to handle it?\" Sanjal, however, was optimistic about the career option she had chosen.\n\nNot only did Sanjal excel as an engineer, but she also ended up designing a space rocket.\n\nAnd she designed this rocket for none other than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos!\n\nIt is a myth that only specific careers options are suitable for girls. [Career options for girls](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options) today are limitless. It is just about focusing and choosing something that matches their interests and skills.

Mehrunissha Shaukat\n\nMehrunissha is India’s first female bouncer. Coming from a conservative background, Mehrunissha had to face a lot of challenges. Her father did not even want Mehrunissha to study beyond the 5th standard. He burnt her uniform when he came to know that she had joined NCC. But Mehrunissha was determined and sincere. She completed her MA in Hindi literature and took a bold decision to become a bouncer. When her father suffered losses in his business, it was Mehrunisha who helped him.

Sanjal's story is a happy reminder that when a door closes, another window opens.\n**Meta Keywords:** Women Achievers, Women Achievers, women empowerment, Success Story, Careers for Women\n\n**Page Title:** Sanjal Gavande- The Space Engineer Who Designed a Rocket Amazon Founder, Jeff Bezos\n\n**Date:** 13th Aug 2021\n**Read Time:** 2 min read0.0 / 5\n\n**Banner Image:** ![Women Achievers](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/hero-image/2022-09/Sanjal%20bavande%20edit.png \"Women Achievers\")\n\n**Article Content:**\n\n**NASA rejected Sanjal Gavande's application for the role of a Space Engineer due to citizenship issues. Little did NASA know that Sanjal would become a space engineer for someone else and achieve the very same feat. Sanjal's story is a happy reminder that when a door closes, another window opens.**\n\n## A humble beginning.\n\nSanjal hails from Maharashtra's Kalyan District, where her father served in the local municipal corporation, and her mother is a retired employee of MTNL.\n\nShe did her initial schooling at Model High School, followed by Birla College, where she completed college. After HSC, she decided to pursue a bachelor in Engineering.\n\nWhile Sanjal was clear that she wanted to go for engineering, it is not easy for everyone to choose their profession.\n\nIt is easy to be confused about which stream should one choose after completing one's HSC or SSC or sometimes even graduation.\n\nCareer counselling and [Psychometric Test](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options)s on career guidance are a good idea to understand one's potential. They make choosing a career path more easy.\n\n### Why Mechanical to Wow Mechanical!\n\nPeople who knew Sanjal had only one question- \"Why Mechanical Engineering? She's a girl. Will she be able to handle it?\"\n\nEngineering is a challenging field. While it opens a variety of options for specialization courses, choosing Mechanical is juggling multiple activities simultaneously. Mechanical engineering involves studying every specialization partially.\n\nSanjal completed her Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and decided to specialize in Aerospace from Michigan Technological University.\n\nSanjal's parents were concerned too.\n\nBut Sanjal put all such concerns to rest after completing her bachelor with a first-class and enrolling for Masters in Aerospace in the USA.\n\n### From Water to Road to Air and Space\n\nAfter completing her Masters, Sanjal interned with Mercury Marine in Wisconsin as a Design Analysis Intern and eventually landed a job as a Design Analysis Engineer.\n\nMercury Marine is known for making outboard motors. An outboard motor is a machine attached to boats and other watercraft that helps in steering them.\n\nHer next job was with Toyota's Racing Department in Orange City in California as a Mechanical Design Engineer.\n\nWhile working with Toyota, Sanjal had not forgotten her aim. While she dedicated weekdays to her profession, weekends were meant to fulfil her passion, chasing her dreams to fly- literally. She took flying lessons and earned a commercial pilot's licence.\n\n### When NASA's loss was Blue Origin's gain\n\nAfter earning her licence, Sanjal applied for Space Engineer at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), which is the Indian equivalent of ISRO. But her application was rejected due to citizenship issues.\n\nSanjal did not let this setback stop her from retrying or achieving her goal. NASA's rejection turned out to be a milestone. She then applied for the same position at Blue Origin. Blue Origin is a private company that aims to make space travel cheaper through reusable launch vehicles. Blue Origin's founder Jeff Bezos is also known for the online shopping portal Amazon.\n\nSanjal cleared the interview and got the job of a system engineer. Eventually, she was selected for the project that built the New Shepard rocket. She was instrumental in building the spaceship.\n\nHer childhood dream of building a spacecraft had finally been realized!\n\nJust like Sanjal, you, too, can realize your childhood dreams if you believe in them. Select a career that suits your likings and your dreams.\n\nHere are [some exciting jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/sheroes-mars-work-from-home) that you may find intriguing. Sometimes, all it takes is a little push.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Women Achievers, women empowerment, Success Story, Careers for Women, Psychometric Tests\n\n",

Money will automatically come in. Saumya’s success story is a classic example of this.\n\nWhen Saumya decided to start her business, she had two objectives in mind:\n\n1. Establish a profitable business\n2. Keep the culture and traditions of India alive and make it easy for people to access them.\n\nAt that time, Saumya was working as a consultant for KPMG in London.\n\nBut, she decided to quit and follow her dream of starting a website for conducting pujas online. It's called – Shubhpuja.com.\n\n### Today, Saumya has achieved both these objectives very well and has many awards and nominations to her credit, such as:\n\n- Femina Women Super Achiever Award\n- Being among the only 2 out of 900 startups in India to be awarded Equity free seed funding\n- Digital Women Entrepreneur of 2016\n- Featured in Top 30 Women Entrepreneurs redefining the digital space in India by SheThePeople.TV\n- Nomination for Silicon Valley 40 under 40\n\nApart from India, Shubhpuja.com has customers all the way from Russia, USA to Hong Kong, Singapore and UK!

We plan to double our sales team to reach out to a wider audience!”*\n\n### How it all started….\n\nIt was a sad incident that led to Saumya starting her own business, though. A friend's father passed away, and most of the family lived abroad while some were in India.\n\nThe entire family, however, had to struggle while organizing the rituals for the cremation process. That is when Saumya realized how difficult it is for many people to get Indian rituals done authentically.\n\n### As a girl, there are many things that Saumya inspires us to do…\n\n- **Being proactive and brave:**\n\nIt could have been easier for Saumya to stick to her job as a high paying consultant in London. Instead, Saumya decided to be brave enough to pursue her dreams. She decided to take the risk and start her own venture.\n\nToday, Saumya has a system where Customers from anywhere in the world can schedule and participate in rituals in India through Skype or Facetime. These rituals are customized for each individual. They are conducted in Sanskrit as per the tradition.\n\nThe requirements for the puja – offerings, garlands and all other things are handled by ShubhPuja.com. The customer only has to log in! The priests conduct the ceremony online as per the rituals.\n\n- **Using Social Media**\n\nSaumya has started her own blog to spread awareness around ancient rituals and the scientific rationale and logic around them.\n\nHer idea is to bring to the people the actual knowledge and logic around these rituals. This also keeps people safe from falling prey to scams and scandals.\n\n[Click here to check out our free online courses on Social Media](https://caa.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/searchResult?searchKey=social%20media)!\n\n**Being digitally savvy, knowing how to use social media effectively is the need of the hour.

His farming is just enough to feed his family. There are no additional crops left for him to trade.

She joined the Yuwa school. Yuwa has undertaken many initiatives to help girls in Jharkhand.

Today, she is also known as India's Wonder Woman. It is due to her ability to fight, defend and an unending list of achievements to her credit.\n\nHer life story is nothing less than a film's script!

Seema's father, Prof. Ramakant Sinari, helped in freeing Goa from the Portuguese.\n\nPatriotism and love for the country were deep-rooted in Seema since her childhood. India's struggle for independence and its journey was another incident that had inspired her to serve the country.\n\n### A career in Combat.\n\nEven after marriage, Seema continued to learn martial arts and shooting while pursuing her education in Medicine. One of the reasons was her husband, Major Deepak Rao.\n\nHe inspired her to learn martial arts. Seema is a 7th-degree black belt holder in military martial arts as well.\n\nAfter becoming a Doctor, Seema did her MBA in Crisis Management.\n\nThe continuous thought of doing something for the country steered her towards training the soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces.\n\n### India's Wonder Woman: With a record-breaking skill in combat training\n\nSeema's strength lies in hand-to-hand and close combat skills, including reflex shooting using rifles & pistols and knives & bare-handed Combat.\n\nShe also runs an Unarmed Commando Combat Academy that trains Jeet Kune Do and other martial arts to the Indian Forces and civilians.\n\n### Training the protectors\n\nSeema has provided training to almost all the elite units of the Indian Armed Forces, such as\n\n- The NSG Black Cats, MARCOS, GARUD, Para commandos, BSF\n- The Army Corps Battle Schools & and commando wing\n- National Police Academy\n- Army Officers Training Academy and the Police Quick Response Teams.\n\nShe earned her IAF Para Wings in 2009 after enrolling for the official IAF Para Jump course. The IAF Chief invited her after she trained the GARUD commandos.\n\n### Reluctance to Acceptance.\n\nSeema broke the stereotype that only men were fit to be in the Armed Forces. And also gained respect and acceptance from men and women alike.\n\nThrough her training regimen, Seema gained acceptance and respect from the trainee commandos, who were initially reluctant about getting trained by a woman.\n\n### By a woman, for the women.\n\nSeema's tailored a safety programme for women to equip them while dealing with potential perpetrators.\n\nThe programme is called DARE: Defence Against Rape & Eve-Teasing. It helps train women physically and mentally to tackle harassment and other related issues.\n\nSeema's selfless contribution to the nation has earned her World Peace Award at World Peace Congress in Malaysia and the US President's Volunteer Service Award.

Speaking fluent English is essential, but writing correct English is equally important. Read more.\n**Meta Keywords:** Free online courses,English Online Courses,Free English course,English learning course,Online Courses India,Online Courses\n\n**Page Title:** Seven Embarrassing Mistakes in English You Need to Be Mindful About, Starting Today\n\n**Date:** 31st Mar 2022\n**Read Time:** 3 min read0.0 / 5\n\n**Banner Image:** ![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/hero-image/2022-05/GALC_Blog_Default_Image_9.jpg \"Online Courses\")\n\n**Article Content:**\n\nWhat is the national language of India? If Hindi was your first thought, you should stop yourself right there. India doesn't have a national language. However, we do have an official language - English. Surprised? Don't be. You can Google it.\n\nEnglish is also one of the most common languages corporates use for communication and marketing. So while being able to fluently speak English is essential, writing correct English is equally critical. Check out the following list of common silly mistakes made while talking and writing. Keep track of how many of these you have been making and correct them immediately. And if you continue to make these mistakes, you may end up not getting the best opportunities due to your weak writing skills.\n\n## You're vs Your\n\nExamples:\n\n- Anita, your feelings for him seem genuine.\n- Anita, what you're feeling for him seems genuine.\n\nIn the first sentence, the word 'your' indicates that the feelings are Anita's. However, in the second sentence, the word you're(short for 'you are') refers to the emotions Anita is experiencing. The following sentence should help you understand this better, \"You're going to get great opportunities if your grammar is good.\"\n\n## There vs Their vs They're\n\nExample:\n\n- Although they're currently living in a small house, there was a time when their palace was the grandest one in the world.\n\nThe above sentence clearly indicates the right way to use there, they're and their. They're is short for they are. The word there indicates a position (in this case, the position of time which is in the past.) The word their indicates ownership of the noun (palace) for a group of people.\n\n## Advise vs Advice\n\nExamples:\n\n- I will advise him to run fast.\n- His advice for us was, \"Run fast\".\n\nTo simply put, advise is the act of giving someone a suggestion. Whereas advice is the suggestion (you should run sat) itself. Another way to understand this is that advice is a message that has been given. Advise is a message that can be, should be or will be provided.\n\n## All together vs Altogether:\n\nExamples:\n\n- We kept the chairs, all together.\n- A patch of wall was overlooked because of which the painting wasn't done altogether.\n\nHere all together suggests a complete set (chairs) was placed in a certain way (all were kept close to each other at the same place). Whereas altogether means 'completely', indicating that the painting of the said wall was left incomplete due to a patch being overlooked.\n\n## Beside vs Besides\n\nExample:\n\n- Besides the old broken chair she was sitting on, the room had no other chair for someone to sit beside her.\n\nBesides means apart from, while beside indicates position - by the side of a place, thing or a person.\n\n## Lose vs Loose\n\nExample:\n\n- Lose weight if you want your pants to feel loose.\n\nLoose - almost always refers to an item that isn't tight enough. Whereas lose indicates a loss.\n\n## Desert vs Dessert\n\nExample:\n\n- We relished cold dessert in the hot desert.\n\nA desert is a barren landmass with extreme temperatures. Whereas a dessert is a sweet dish eaten after the main course.\n\nIf this article felt challenging to understand, you should [learn English](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=english) by taking online courses from Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation)\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Free online courses, English Online Courses, Free English course, English learning course, Online Courses India\n\n",

As a mother, she also wants to be actively involved in her daughter’s education. She is proud of sending her to an International school. Being fluent in English also helps Shimmi assist her daughter in her school projects and assignments too.\n\nShimmi strongly urges other women who find themselves in her position to pursue the online English courses on the Glow and Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair and Lovely Career Foundation) website. Having led a tough life as a single parent, she realizes the importance of being financially independent. The only way forward is to keep boosting your skills and updating your knowledge.

I'm sure you are all excited to start this new journey. Now that you have finished college and are about to start work, you will be independent and earn your own salary. Essentially, you are about to jump into the real world. Even with all the excitement, it is entirely normal to feel hesitant.\n\n## Here are six things that every woman should know after college and before joining the workforce.\n\n1. **You aren't guaranteed instant success.**You may not get the first job that you interviewed for. Or even the second. There may be many rejections, but there will always be a yes. Don't give up. Take up internships or minor roles in the field and work hard. Remember that every role is important and has a part to play. Success will come to you.\n2. **Your first job may not be all that.**You're just out of college. Your first job will probably have you in a small role. You will be expected to learn the ropes. Most likely, you will start at the bottom and raise yourself up.\n3. **The real world isn't all work and no play.**While it is true that with independence comes great responsibility, that doesn't mean it has to be miserable. The real world isn't rainbows for sure. You will be salaried and expected to care for yourself and maybe provide for your family. However, don't forget to live for yourself a little. Choose a job you enjoy. Don't work outside of your work hours. Please stay away from miserable coworkers who hate their job. Remember, misery loves company - you may end up feeling low too.\n4. **Someone you know might be more successful.**Someone who studied with you might end up doing something else. It might seem that they are doing way better. They might be more successful and live a better lifestyle. You might feel a little resentful. But don't get caught up comparing. It will not do you any good.\n5. **Pay attention at work.**This doesn't only include meetings. Of course, pay attention during meetings - take down notes. It will come in handy. More importantly, pay attention to everything at work. Notice how your seniors handle their workload. Note the risks they take and the battles they choose to fight. Learn from everyone around you. Pay attention to e-mails. 99% of the time, they contain workload information. Remember to communicate clearly without leaving room for doubt. Don't fall for passive-aggressive tactics, gossip and office politics.\n6. **Don't get stuck**Your education might be over, but that doesn't mean your learning should stop. Keep up-to-date with your job requirements. Learn as you grow. Figure out your strengths and weaknesses and work on them. Most importantly, the day of holding down a job for all your life is gone. Be smart and take up new and better opportunities when they arise. Stay on good terms as you move on - remember, most industries are smaller than you think.\n\nNow that you are ready, check out [exciting jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs) at Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).

Let’s explore the role of women in India's **aerospace industry** and how they are shaping the future of space exploration in the country.\n\nIndia’s space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), has been at the forefront of space exploration, with many **women scientists** having played pivotal roles in its success. They have been involved in satellite design, mission planning, and launch and their expertise has been instrumental in India's rising presence in the global space arena.\n\nIndia's academic institutions have also recognized the importance of encouraging women to pursue careers in **space engineering**. Several universities and technical institutes nationwide offer specialized **aerospace courses** that provide students a strong foundation and offer hands-on experience through [internships](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs/internships) and practical training.\n\nThe influx of women in India's **aerospace industry** can be attributed to the growing awareness about gender equality and diversity in the workplace. Government initiatives and scholarships promoting STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) among women have also played a significant role.\n\nOne of the more notable success stories is that of Dr. Tessy Thomas, often called the \"Missile Woman of India.\" Dr. Thomas is a renowned scientist at DRDO (Defense Research and Development Organization) and has made remarkable contributions to India's missile programs. Her journey from a small Kerala town to becoming a leading figure in space technology is a testament to women's potential in this field. \n\n\n\n![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/Space%20Exploration%20and%20Women.png) *[768x523]*\n\nAnother great example is Dr. Minal Sampath, a scientist at ISRO. Dr. Sampath played a crucial role in India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan). Her dedication and expertise have earned her recognition as a role model for aspiring women in space research across the world. \n\n\n\n![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/Space%20Exploration%20and%20Women%202.jpg) *[756x425]*\n\nIndia's Mars Orbiter Mission was particularly significant, as it showcased India's capability to explore interplanetary missions. This success was a collective effort, with women scientists contributing significantly to the mission's success. The increased involvement of women in space exploration is not just about breaking stereotypes but is essential for the progress of the field. Diverse perspectives and skills brought by women scientists enrich the industry and contribute to innovative solutions and ground-breaking discoveries.\n\nAs India continues to push boundaries in space exploration, the role of women scientists will only become more prominent. The future holds exciting opportunities for women in the aerospace sector, from exploring the Moon and Mars to developing cutting-edge technologies for space missions. India's journey in space exploration is evolving, and the contribution of **women scientists** is undeniable.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on STEM education and support from academic institutions offering **aerospace courses**, the future of space exploration in India looks promising.

Confirm that there are no other blogs with the same name before finalising yours.\n2. **Get your blog online: **Your blog needs to be somewhere on the internet for people to find it. To get your blog online and running smoothly, you need blog hosting (also known as web hosting) and blogging software. More often than not, these come as a package deal.

Opting for this is easier as there is no coding involved. You can always tweak the template with in-house tools to suit you better. You can add your logo and social media handles to customise it further.\n4. **Write & publish your first post: **Now that the set-up is done. All that's left is to start sharing your thoughts with the world. This is where it gets real. Choose an attractive title and write some quality content - make sure it is interactive and not too dull. Most importantly, be yourself and share your views freely. Keep it original, and don't forget to proofread it.\n5. **Promote your blog:** After you're done publishing your blog. The next step is to get more people to read your blog. This can be done with proper marketing. The first step is to alert your inner circle. Share your blog on social media too.

There are many[ exciting jobs](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/exciting-jobs) and career opportunities available for STEM students.\n\nIt is a promising career, and one can expect a bright future ahead by taking up this opportunity.\n\nThere are also many [free online courses available](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) that helping increase one's knowledge in STEM.\n\n## Here are some career options that one can look at as a STEM student:\n\n**Science-** The 'S' in STEM is formal and natural sciences. This mainly includes biology, chemistry, and environmental science; some focus on mathematics and statistics. One can become a biological technician who helps scientists in laboratory tests and experiments.\n\n**Technology-** By choosing technology as a career field, many options can be considered, like-computer programming, cyber security, information technology, robotics, etc.\n\n**Engineering-** Engineering is a vast field and has significant demand compared to the other STEM disciplines. It usually includes designing and building machines, roads, etc., using scientific principles. There are several job opportunities in engineering. Some of them are- chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, etc.\n\n**Mathematics- **All the fields of STEM include mathematics to some extent. This includes arithmetic, geometry, algebra. Actuaries also use math and statistics in their daily job to assess the financial costs of various risks for businesses.\n\nIn short, there is a vast array of job opportunities to choose from in STEM. Astronomers, computer science, biomedical engineering, chemistry, industrial engineering, scientist, computer programming, etc. – are just some of them.\n\n### There are many inspiring stories of girls who have achieved success in these fields.\n\nTake the example of Divya Tulapurkar. She was an engineering student who decided to pursue Analytics. Analytics can be called a combination of mathematics and technology.

Ritu combined her knowledge of coding and banking to rise in the business. It was not easy for Ritu. There were financial hardships. And girls are usually not encouraged to take up Maths, Technology or Science. Many are encouraged to take up safe options such as Arts or Teaching.\n\nBut Ritu did not give up. She decided to pursue her passion for technology and finance.\n\nAnd her hard work paid off! You can read Ritu's success story here.\n\nWhile some believe that girls are not as good at STEM as boys, this is far from reality. Take Navshri Thakur's example. A farmer's daughter, this 14-year-old girl is now a NIF award winner.\n\nUsing the knowledge of science and maths that she learnt in school, she created a new product that could help her mother reduce her household work. Her innovation won her an award from NIF!\n\nAnd if anyone thought that girls might be only good at kitchen stuff and household work, they could not be more wrong!\n\nHave you heard about Sanjal Gavande? She is a space engineer. She is also the girl who was a part of a team that designed a rocket. And they created this rocket for non-other than Jeff Bezos - the founder of Amazon.\n\nAnd then there is Komal Mangtani. She is a Director at Uber. Her advice when it comes to technology is simple. She asks everyone to broaden the definition of technology. Match using technology with one's interest.\n\nShe gives an example of YouTube and Facebook. One may develop something like YouTube because she or she likes love watching videos. Or create the next Facebook because they want to socialize.\n\nThis advice applies to those who wish to pursue STEM too. It is all about broadening one's perspective and outlook.\n\nMany remarkable young women like [Ritu, Komal ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/blog/career-tech-has-no-gender-272)and [Sanjal Gavande](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/blog/sanjal-gavande-space-engineer-who-designed-rocket-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-259) have created their own success stories by making a career in STEM.

It gives hope to everyone who has set out on the mission to achieve something, whether good health, savings, career development or well-being. The first step to achieving these goals is to have a positive mindset.\n\nGenerally, people begin the year with a set of resolutions to achieve their goals; however, they tend to fail within a month or two without the **right mindset**. Having a **positive mindset** with a winning attitude can help accomplish these goals and much more. Only a few are born with this mindset; the rest need to develop it.\n\n## Here’s how you can work on building a winning mindset:\n\n1. Begin your journey by believing in yourself and your dreams. Nothing is impossible once you start trusting your capabilities to accomplish your goals.\n2. Stay focused on your goals. There will be many hurdles and obstacles on your path to success, but you need to keep going.\n3. Things may move slowly but stay patient in your journey. Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day.\n4. Keep track of your progress. It will keep you motivated and boost your confidence. Sometimes you feel like giving up; this progress tracker will remind you of your potential and help you keep at it.\n5. Celebrate small and big wins. Reward yourself with things you like. This will keep you positively motivated.\n6. Adopt positive habits of exercising, going for walks, thinking good thoughts and staying away from negative people and situations as much as possible.\n7. The most important step in building a winning mindset is always being kind to yourself. Learn from your mistakes rather than being discouraged.\n\n### Developing a growth mindset:\n\nA **winning mindset** and a **growth mindset** often go hand in hand. A **growth mindset** is about how a person approaches problems, how they deal with setbacks, and how they adjust and change. The **growth mindset** needs to be developed and nurtured. It is formed by years of experience.\n\n### Here are some examples of how you can adopt this mindset.\n\n1. Change doesn't happen overnight. Take small steps towards your goals. Make positive actions a part of your daily life.\n2. Crave for something new. Get out of your comfort zone. Try a new hobby or challenge yourself to do something you haven’t done before.\n3. Much like the **winning mindset**, the **growth mindset** takes time to develop. Keep going even if you do not see instant results. Stay focused and consistent.\n4. Look out for new perspectives. Read books, meet new people, discuss ideas, and be open to feedback and their viewpoints. Challenge your old self. It will make it easier for you to find answers and new solutions.\n\nThe **right mindset** knows you can achieve anything you have set your mind to, no matter the obstacles and distractions.\n\n[Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) offers you tips, [counselling and guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options) to help you develop the **right mindset **to achieve your goals.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** winning mindset, positive mindset, right mindset, growth mindset, Career Guidance\n\n",

You will have to pack a lot into your daily routine and that can take its toll on your mental health. Not only will a stressful life lower your efficiency, it will also prevent you from leading a healthy and happy life.\n\nIt is hard to lead a completely stress-free life, and simple resilience at the workplace may not be enough. You have to not only take steps to make sure to minimize stress but also develop skills that will teach you how to reduce stress at work.\n\n## Keeping that in mind, here are a few tips to stay stress-free, relatively speaking:\n\n### 1. Eating Healthy\n\nIf you are serious about reducing stress, you have to get into the habit of eating healthy. Often due to stress and long work hours, you may be tempted to eat unhealthy food. It is normal to want to treat yourself once in a while, but you have to see to it that your overall eating habits are healthy.\n\n### 2. Start Following a Routine\n\nFollowing a routine will have a two-fold effect on you. You will be able to organize work and complete it on time. The better you manage your time, the more free time you will have. You can then use the free time for entertainment and relaxation, which will help you feel less stressed.\n\n### 3. Prioritize Things\n\nWhen you feel burdened with work from office and work at home, the only way to deal with the clutter and stress is to prioritize. By putting things in order of importance, you can make smart choices about how and how much time to spend on your work.\n\n### 4. Avoid Delays\n\nYou may not want to do things when they are pending, but putting things off for a later time adds to your long-term stress. So, by facing the workload head-on and in a timely fashion, you are not only accomplishing tasks at hand, you are also protecting yourself from additional stress.\n\n### 5. Increasing Focus\n\nTo be able to successfully handle and reduce stress, you have to avoid distractions like your mobile phone, and the temptation to watch videos etc. This will lead to better focus, and your output will be much better thus, helping you achieve your goals.\n\n### 6. Exercise\n\nUnless you live a very active lifestyle, chances are, you are ignoring your physical health. Part of living a healthy and stress-free life is being physically active. You can choose to go for a run, join a gym or practice yoga too. Doing yoga and meditation will help you to be more mindful for stress reduction. You can also take an easy-to-follow course online that the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) offers called Mindfulness and Resilience to Stress at Work (click [here](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/edx-berkeleyx+gg202x/mindfulness-and-resilience-to-stress-at-work)).\n\n### 7. Take Time for Yourself\n\nA change of pace can be very helpful when you are in a stressful environment. This means you should not hesitate to take time for yourself, be it relaxing with friends, taking a day off from work, taking a short trip outside the city or simply staying home and relaxing can do wonders to refresh your mind.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Healthcare, Clinical Psychologist, Stress-Free, Online Courses, Stress at Work\n\n",

For this, what you need is a proper study plan. Following a well-structured study plan will surely help you to crack the SSC online exam without having to depend on any coaching centers. Since the SSC exams are mostly online, the wisest idea would be to do online test preparation and to keep practicing SSC online mock tests.\n\nThe SSC (Staff Selection Commission) conducts exams for various posts coming under different ministries/departments in India. Some of these exams are the CGL (Combined Graduate Level) exam, Junior Engineer exam, Stenographers (Grade C and D) exam, SSC JHT exam and more. These exams are conducted from time to time throughout the year. Most SSC exams have almost the same syllabus, with one or two of the sections differing based on the particular exam. For example, in the SSC JE exam, there will be a section with engineering questions as this exam is conducted to recruit candidates for the Junior Engineer post. Similarly, for the JHT (Junior Hindi Translator) post, there will be questions to test the candidate’s proficiency in Hindi. Apart from these, most SSC exams have the following syllabus:\n\nQuantitative Aptitude: Data Interpretation, Simplification/ Approximation, Number Series, Quadratic Equations, Quantity based problems, Ratio & Proportion, Percentage & Averages, Profit & Loss, Mixtures & Allegations, Pipes and Cisterns, Boats and Streams, Simple Interest & Compound Interest, Time, Work and Wages, Time & Distance, Permutation, Combination & Probability\n\nLogical Reasoning: Seating Arrangement (Circular, Linear, Square), Puzzles, Syllogism, Input-Output, Coding-Decoding, Blood Relations, Alphanumeric Series/Number Series/Alphabet Series, Order and Ranking, Direction based questions, Data sufficiency, Inequalities\n\nEnglish: Reading Comprehension, Cloze test, Fill in the blanks, Error Spotting/New Pattern Error Spotting, Sentence Correction/Sentence Improvement, Para Jumbles, Para Summary, Odd One Out, Para Completion\n\nGeneral Studies: Questions in this section may be asked from numerous topics including Biology, Chemistry, Polity, Economy, etc.\n\nThe Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) provides free [online aptitude tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-tests) that you can take to ace the Quantitative Aptitude and Logical Reasoning sections of the exam.\n\nNow that you have an idea of the syllabus for the exam, you can create a detailed study plan. Here are a few tips for the same:\n\n1. Identify your weak areas and plan to work on those during that period of the day where you feel you can be most productive. For some people, it is the morning hours, and for some, it is the night time. Spend these productive hours practicing aptitude questions or maybe doing some English comprehension questions, if English is the toughest for you.\n\n2. Make sure you spend at least 2 hours every day studying for all the 4 sections.\n\n3. For each subject, aim to get the basic concepts cleared first. For example, in the first 3 months of preparation, aim to cover the following portions under each subject:\n\nQuantitative Aptitude: Basic Algebra (linear equations, polynomials, quadratic equations), number series, percentage, average, ratio & proportion, Simple & Compound interest, basic geometry\n\nReasoning & Intelligence: Figure based questions, letter, and number based questions, blood relation, direction & distance, seating arrangement\n\nEnglish Language: Basic grammar, vocabulary, synonyms & antonyms, sentence completion. Also, aim to keep increasing your reading speed.\n\nOnce the foundation for every subject is made strong, then you can easily build on it.\n\n4. In the next 3 months, aim to work on the rest of the topics and complete the entire syllabus in 6 months. This is easily possible as you will be devoting at least 6-7 hours daily. Only if you finish the entire syllabus in 6 months, you will get ample time to practice mock tests and online mock exams[ ](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/online-tests)in the remaining months.\n\n5. In the last 2-3 months of preparation, you need to devote a lot of time practicing previous years’ question papers. This is extremely important as you will get clarity on the specific portions that you need to emphasize in case you are falling behind on any.\n\n6. In addition to solving online practices questions and mock exams every day, make sure you learn the various shortcut methods, tips, and tricks to easily solve Maths and other questions. This will give you an edge over the other candidates. Make notes of all important equations, formulae, etc. and study them by-heart.\n\n7. Make sure you are accessing the right online study material while preparing for these important exams. You will find a lot of material online, but not everything might be dependable. So, ensure that you are not wasting time on material that does not have the potential to bring out the best in you.\n\nThe key to cracking a competitive exam without taking help from a coaching centre is to manage time and follow a strict daily routine. If you can manage your time well, then with the help of the Glow & Lovely Careers, you can easily crack any SSC exam and come out with flying colours.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Guidance, SSC Exam\n\n",

Here is Namita Thapar's inspirational story.\n\nNamita Thapar was born on March 21, 1977, in Pune to Satish Mehta and Bhavana Mehta. Her father is the founder of the business Emcure Pharmaceuticals. He was the first person in the family to start a business.\n\nNamita was lucky to have family who supported her completely. She did her best to be worthy of their support. From an early age, Namita was very focused on her education. She was also quite good at it. At only 21 years old, she cleared the C.A. exam on the first attempt, making her parents very proud.\n\nNamita always wanted to be a businesswoman. This is why she dedicated herself to learning about business early on. After graduating from the ICAI, she went to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business in the U.S.A. to get an M.B.A. In her own words, she said,\" The average age of the class was 28, and I was much younger. They still took me.\"\n\nSoon after her M.B.A., Namita was offered the position of Business Finance lead in the financial department of Guidant Corporation, a medical device company in the U.S.A. She spent 6 years at the company in various finance and marketing positions and then resigned.\n\nDuring her time in the U.S.A., she got married to Vikas Thapar. Together, the couple has two lovely children named Vir Thapar and Jai Thapar. Now a mother, she was still helping her father with his company from the U.S. When Satish Mehta raised money for Emcure Pharmaceuticals from private equity giant Blackstone, Namita decided it was time to return to India.\n\nIn 2007, Namita officially joined Emcure Pharmaceuticals as a C.F.O. She began managing multifunctional portfolios like finance, domestic marketing, and H.R. She was soon appointed as the Executive Director of Emcure Pharmaceuticals.

She is the CEO of Sugar Cosmetics and one of the judges or 'sharks' in the reality show Shark Tank. None of this came easy to her. In fact, her story is one of inspiration. Here's her story.\n\nVineeta Singh was born in Delhi in 1983. Her father, Tej Singh, is a scientist at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, while her mother worked at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Delhi. She completed her education from the Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram. It was there, when she was 17 years old, that she decided what she wanted to do in life. She credits her decision to one of her teachers, who suggested that Vineeta become an entrepreneur. From that day onward, Vineeta made it her goal.\n\nA studious girl from the very beginning, she studied really hard and successfully got into IIT, Madras. She graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 2005. After which, she pursued her MBA at IIM Ahmedabad.\n\nWith education from such prestigious institutes, it's only natural that Vineeta received good offers for work. She revealed that one of the offers she turned down was for a salary of INR 1 Cr. But Vineeta was firm - She wanted to start her own business. Even the questions and disappointment from her friends and family did not deter her. She was steadfast in her decision.\n\nWith a head full of dreams, at 23 years, Vineeta moved to Mumbai. The city of dreams was initially not kind to her. Like many other youngsters, she too struggled to make ends meet. She said, \"I lived in a tiny house which flooded easily. I'd hardly go out because I was on a budget. But I pushed on.\" In Mumbai, Vineeta gave wings to her dream of entrepreneurship. However, her first business did not do well. Vineeta recalls this being the first time she wondered if she made the right decision turning down the 1Cr. job offer. After all, she would be doing very well with that kind of money. To deal with the self-doubt, Vineeta took up running as a sport. She believes that it helps her clear her head. Today, the sport plays a significant role in her life. In fact, she once ran a marathon while six months pregnant.\n\nA year after her first failure, she gave entrepreneurship another chance with Fab Bags subscription service. While researching for the brand, she realised India's lack of quality cosmetics. Thus, in 2015 Sugar was born.\n\nFrom being rejected by investors to gaining funding, she worked hard to get Sugar cosmetics where it is, all while taking care of two kids. Today, the company's net worth is around 300 Cr. Incredible, right? She has been featured in Fortune 40 Under 40 List 2021, The Economic Times, Entrepreneur magazine, Times Of India, YourStory, HT Mint, and much more. In addition to Fab Bags and Sugar Cosmetics, Vineeta has invested in Skippi Ice Pops and CosIQ, all of which are highly profitable. She also charged INR 5 Lakhs to appear as a Shark for each Shark Tank Episode.

However, moving to a big city from a small town is a life-changing decision. It should not be taken lightly. For starters, it is expensive. Living alone, away from your friends and family, can be very stressful. A big city like Mumbai is crowded, but not knowing anyone around can leave you feeling isolated and lonely. On the other hand, it is the city of dreams. There is the potential of better work opportunities, the excitement of being independent and ample opportunities for learning.\n\nWhether it’s for pursuing higher studies or starting your career, you must make your decision after considering all the pros and cons. We caught up with Tanya Mathana, who is the COO of a Digital Advertising Agency. She came to Mumbai from Bhopal to pursue a career in advertising. And in just 10 years, she has risen to the level of senior management.\n\n## In an exclusive interview, Tanya tells us about the struggles of moving to a big city and why it has all been worth it for her.\n\n### 1. How old were you when you moved to Mumbai from Bhopal?\n\nI was barely 18, quite young, fresh out of school.\n\n### 2. What made you decide to move to a big city?\n\nBack in my hometown, the career options were very limited. You could choose to become a doctor, an engineer, a teacher, or a banker at best. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to pursue at that stage, but I knew that I wanted to pursue something different and exciting. So, I took to the internet to research and discovered many new and exciting career opportunities. As luck would have it, I came across an upcoming course in Media and Communications called BMM (Bachelors of Mass Media). I liked the course structure. So, I decided to move to Mumbai to pursue the course.\n\n### 3. Was your family supportive of your decision?\n\nInitially, everyone in my family had reservations, since it was such a big step. They were quite scared of the fact that I would be all alone. But, after a lot of arguments and conversations, looking at my determination and confidence, my family finally gave in and supported my decision.\n\n### 4. How long have you been staying on your own in this city?\n\nI have stayed for around 10 years by myself. In these 10 years, I’ve made a lot of good friends who have practically become my second family now.\n\n### 5. What are the pros and cons of living on your own?\n\nMissing your family and feeling lonely is a given when you move to a big city. But I sincerely believe that all these challenges make you a stronger person over time. You become more confident and independent.\n\n### 6. How has this city influenced your thinking and lifestyle?\n\nThe city has exposed me to a different sort of culture. It is a lot more inclusive.\n\n### 7. Would you like to move back to your hometown someday?\n\nProbably, yes, someday. But, in the meanwhile, my efforts will always be driven towards encouraging the girls from my hometown. To help them believe in their dreams and to guide and mentor them through my experiences.\n\n### 8. Have you ever been scared for your safety, considering that you are living alone in the city?\n\nNot really. Mumbai has been very kind to me. I have always felt very safe in this city.\n\n### 9. What must one consider before relocating to a new city for a job?\n\nFind out as much as you can about the new city, its culture, the company and its work culture, its people, and the job profile. The more informed you are, the better prepared you’ll be.\n\n### 10. What advice would you like to give young girls from small towns who want to move to a big city?\n\n**Stay Updated **– Always try and stay ahead of the curve by reading a lot. There is enough information available on the internet today about choosing the right career, career guidance, and various courses that you can pursue online or offline.\n\n**Be Inspired –** There are so many women achievers and role models who have made their mark in their respective fields. Get inspired by their success stories and apply that knowledge and learning in your journey.\n\n**Stay Curious** – Always stay curious about new things coming up in your field of choice. You will get a lot of information on the internet. You just have to look for it.\n\nIf you are curious to know about more women like Tanya who have created a successful career for themselves despite the odds, head to Fair and Lovely Career Foundation’s [career guidance section](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/blog/) and get even more inspiration.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Guidance, Career in advertising, women empowerment, Female role model, Digital Strategist, Achieving Goals\n\n",

Although we frequently do this unconsciously, we must teach ourselves to stop. Constantly comparing ourselves to others can cause negative thoughts, even though it may **motivate** us** **to become better versions of ourselves.\n\nWe are social creatures, and comparing ourselves with others has been prevalent throughout history. Social media sites constantly post about our shortcomings. These comparison-based apps tempt us to consider different aspects of our own lives.\n\nLow self-esteem and unhappiness are the results of excessive comparison. As a feeling of 'not being up to the mark,' we either get frustrated with ourselves or angry with others.\n\nIf comparisons persist, feelings of resentment, frustration, and hopelessness appear. Such behaviour can lead to chronic anxiety and depression if left untreated.\n\nPeople may seek out others' flaws to feel better and avoid comparisons. This behaviour is unhealthy socially and for your mental and physical health too.\n\n## Here are some steps you can take to stop comparing yourself to others.\n\n### 1. Recognise your triggers and steer clear of them.\n\nList the circumstances and situations that give you grief or cause you to be pessimistic about improving your mental and emotional health.\n\nDo you regularly receive criticism from someone in your life? Or perhaps you feel inferior when a co-worker boasts. When you become aware of the circumstances that lead you to compare things, you can take steps to stay away from them.\n\n### 2. Set time limits for using social media\n\nSocial media informs us about our family, friends, and current events while promoting awareness. Remember, moderation is key. Unfollow accounts that make you think about others' comparisons to yourself. After a particular hour of the day, turn off your phone, and refrain from answering every message or comment you get.\n\n### 3. Give thanks for everything.\n\nBe appreciative of what you have. Even though someone else's life may appear better, someone else may envy what you have. You can find a couple of things for which to be grateful. Use these tactics to improve your gratitude routine.\n\n### 4. Focus on your strengths\n\nWhile being modest is acceptable, you should also be proud of your accomplishments. Just as too much self-confidence can be harmful, so can too much humility.\n\n### 5. Self-motivation is important\n\nAs a part of self-motivation, you should do things that make you happy, activities that bring you joy. **Intrinsic motivation **gives you the satisfaction of doing things** **because it brings happiness rather than specific outcomes.\n\n### 6. Keep in mind that everyone has insecurities\n\nYou're entitled to compare yourself to others. Now and then, self-doubts and fears overpower us for various reasons.

Learning a foreign language gives you more job opportunities and makes your work life more enjoyable. People no longer have to struggle to talk to others in their native language, especially when doing business. With the help of new technology, the world has become a smaller place. Now, more than ever, the language barrier needs to be broken. Learning a foreign language can give you an advantage when looking for a job.\n\n## Career scope as a translator:\n\nAs a translator, you will write, analyse, and edit written text in one language to make it fit into another language. Skilled translators are always in demand. They make a good living because they have a lot of experience, learn a lot, and specialise.\n\nBecause languages are so complicated, machines can't and won't ever be able to do the job of human translators. There are words in different languages that can mean more than one thing. What works well in one language might not work well in another.\n\nThe Machine can't understand how words fit together. Human translators and interpreters are much more reliable and accurate, and the \"personal\" aspect will always beat technology.\n\n### A career in translation:\n\nIn 3–4 years, you can become a translator. But it will take a few years to be successful and respected in fields like finance, law, medicine, technology, and literature. Students can translate literary works from other languages.\n\nSelf-help, science, research, and business books are also becoming more popular to turn into audiobooks. In the publishing business, there are also jobs. Many businesses need translators for essential tasks like business communication, live events, meetings, conferences, and documentation. Many companies that offer translation services hire people who speak more than one language well. The translator is one of the most popular jobs in languages because it pays well, is becoming more important, and has flexible hours.\n\nJapanese and German are also popular in India because Germany and Japan have well-developed economies that offer many job opportunities in India and around the world. Over the past few years, there has been a rise in the number of Indians who want to learn Portuguese, Italian, Korean, and Russian. Knowing English is always a plus, as in most business dealings, one or more people speak in English. As a translator in India, you will have to know at least two languages, but preferably three. These include One Local Indian Language, depending on where you work, One global language to talk to foreigners native to the language and, of course, English.\n\nYou will be required to dress well and look presentable. You will need to have basic etiquette and a good personality. Brushing up on your skills before going for a job interview as a translator is always a good idea. Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) provides free courses on [Interview tips, etiquette and personality improvement](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) to help you gain the upper edge.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Language Translators In India, Language Translators as Careers, Career scope as a translator, A career in translation, Human translators\n\n",

**Mehrunnisha Shaukat Ali**: Mehrunnisha always dreamt of joining the army or becoming a police officer to protect people. But her orthodox father didn’t support her dream. Soon the family moved to Delhi, where she secretly joined NCC (National Cadet Corps). After successful completion of her course and training, she brought her uniform home. But her angry father burnt it. After long periods of trying to convince him, she finally started working. She was initially the sole breadwinner of the family. She then realised that she could still pursue her dream of ‘protecting people’ partially, if not entirely. So she got a job as a bouncer at a famous nightclub in Delhi to become the **first female bouncer of India**. Her regular gym and karate training helped her a lot in this job. Soon her younger sister also became a bouncer.

***Shreya Iyer***: Shreya has liked bikes since childhood. At 17, she rode her 1st bike by convincing her friend to ride his new bike. She went on a ride alone and returned without a single scratch. And then there was no looking back! She also learnt how to maintain a bike.

***Sangita Pingle***: Sangita decided to farm on the 13-acre farmland left behind by her father-in-law after his death. Being a widow, mother of 2 and sole bread earner of the family, it was their only hope. Everyone doubted if she could do it because she was a woman. But she proved everyone wrong by successfully cultivating grapes and tomatoes on her vineyard. Today she earns lakhs. She is the perfect example of determination, patience, hard work and courage. She learnt everything from riding a two-wheeler to a tractor, repairing damaged machinery, inspecting plants, handling pesticides, using various tools, going to the market etc. She did all the jobs which otherwise men and women, both are required to do. She is ***one of the very few women who know and do end to end farming solutions***.\n\n*If you want some more inspiration to break the stereotype, *[*read this*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/blog/ladki-hai-kya-kar-sakti-hai-meet-10-inspiring-women-who-answer-it-280)*!*\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Success Stories, Women Achievers, Inspirational Women in India, Free career guidance, Inspiring Story\n\n",

But before we share that, let us look at the meaning of social entrepreneurs.\n\n## What does being a social entrepreneur mean?\n\nA social entrepreneur builds a business that is for the benefit of society. It solves the problems of the society and improves the overall standard of living of the common man.\n\nHere are 3 such success stories of social entrepreneurs\n\n1. **Aditi Gupta, Co-Founder of Menstrupedia **\n\nThere is a lot of awkwardness associated with menstruation or 'periods' as it is commonly called. Many consider it to be impure and are unwilling to discuss it. This results in a lack of knowledge.\n\nThis is harmful for young girls.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to educate young girls about menstruation. Teach them about hygiene. Explain to them the changes in their body. Educate them on how to be confident, responsible young girls.\n\nAditi had similar thoughts. That is why she started Menstrupedia. It aims to teach young girls about menstruation through comic strips. These comic strips are intelligent and simple to understand.\n\nSo powerful was Aditi's venture that in less than 10 years, more than 10 thousand schools have made use of Menstrupedia to help young girls understand menstruation.\n\n1. **Abhilasha Purwar, founder of Blue Sky Analytics**\n\nAn IIT graduate. Post-graduation from Yale University in the US on a full scholarship. Rock climber. Certified Yoga practitioner. And a start-up founder whose focus is how to make the environment better.\n\nThere are so many things to know about Abhilasha!\n\nAbhilasha completed her graduation in Applied Physics from IIT Bhubaneshwar. At that time, IIT graduates, as young as 22 years old, were offered salaries worth 18 lakh. Abhilasha, however, wanted to use her education to give back to society. She decided to work with Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab on an air pollution monitoring project. That was her first brush with an environmental project.\n\nAfter completing her post-graduation, Abhilasha set up Blue Sky Analytics. It makes use of Artificial intelligence and satellites to provide data. This data can be used to manage climate change and monitor pollution levels.\n\nAbhilasha could have taken any job that she wanted and demanded a very lucrative salary. Abhilasha instead decided to focus on what she could do for her country and the world.\n\nAbhilasha is really an inspiration for young girls today!\n\n1. **Sairee Chahal**** **\n\nWomen are as talented as men. However, there are additional responsibilities that women need to handle.\n\nAfter marriage and kids, many women choose to stay at home. They look for job opportunities that allow flexible working hours. This helps them get time to take care of their home and kids. Keeping this need in mind, Sairee started Sheroes. It offers women a platform to connect, seek career guidance, employment opportunities, and so on…\n\nIt also helps identify work from home job opportunities for women.

For some, it is fighting against the odds to complete college graduation, for some, it is becoming the first woman in the family to get a job. For others, it may be to qualify and attain a scholarship that will help further their dreams. In a country like ours, a growing number of women are looking to work and are making their own success stories in the process.\n\nGlow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) scholarships have enabled several women to pursue their education and move a step closer to their dream of having a career. There may be a number of reasons why someone might be in need of a scholarship. We have as an example, the case of Arshia, who was a B Tech student, to see how scholarships help students. Arshia was in the first year of her graduation when her father passed away in an accident. To support the family, her mother began running a small shop. As the oldest in her family, Arshia knew she needed to complete her graduation and find a job to support her family. She applied and received a scholarship from the Glow and Lovely Careers, which covered the cost of an entire year of her education. This significantly eased her financial burden and enabled her to focus on her studies, thus setting her up well for the future.\n\nAnother amazing story is that of Swati Bhura. She is from Kolkata and when she was quite young, she lost her mother. To help support her education and her family, she began taking tuitions while she was still finishing school. Her goal was to complete her education and become a Chartered Accountant. She was looking for scholarships for women and found out about our scholarship program through a newspaper advertisement. She won a scholarship and was not only able to successfully complete her CA course, she has also worked with some of the most prestigious companies including, Deloitte and Coca Cola since becoming a CA.\n\nSometimes, we may not be able to understand how to apply for a scholarship. Take the example of Vijaya from Seondha. Vijaya was already an Electronics engineer but wanted to become an Indian Public Services officer. She even quit her job to prepare but as luck would have it, she could not clear the preliminary that was held in 2017. A good friend of hers informed of the opportunity to apply for a scholarship by the Glow and Lovely Careers. When Vijaya applied and was selected for the scholarship, it gave her the chance to focus completely on her IPS preparation, freeing her of the stress and financial burden.\n\nTo follow your passion and become a successful woman, you may need help that might not be easily available at times. These women showed us the power of persistence and also finding the right help. If you too feel like you need some financial aid in order to pursue your education or prepare for an exam, you should certainly try to apply for a [scholarship with the Glow and Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/scholarship-for-women).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Scholarships for women, Applying for scholarships, Opportunities for women, Scholarship opportunities, Glow and Lovely Careers Scholarships\n\n",

It will give you confidence and help secure good marks in the CTET exam. Here are some useful tips to crack the CTET exam.\r\n\n**Meta Keywords:** Online Tests, Teaching, Career in Teaching, CTET Preparation, CTET Mock Test, CTET Teaching Exam  \n\n**Page Title:** These Top Tips Will Help You Crack the CTET Exams for Teaching\n\n**Date:** 23rd Jun 2020\n**Read Time:** 2 min read0.0 / 5\n\n**Banner Image:** ![tips to crack the CTET exam](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/hero-image/2020-06/career%20in%20teaching.jpg \"tips to crack the CTET exam\")\n\n**Article Content:**\n\nCentral Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) is conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for teaching positions from classes 1 to 8. CBSE includes Central Government Schools such as Kendriya Vidyalaya, Central Tibetan Schools, and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya along with schools under the administrative control of Union Territories. CTET exams are conducted twice a year. The CBSE releases notification on its website and newspapers before the exams. It is important that you stay updated to avoid last-minute panic and stress.\n\nIf you want a career in teaching, you must take the CTET exam. The teaching position in a CBSE school has many perks. However, it is a very competitive exam and difficult to crack in the first attempt. To start with, you need to plan an effective preparation strategy. It is advisable for you to start preparing and planning at least a year in advance. It will give you confidence and help secure good marks in the CTET exam.\n\n## Here are some useful tips to crack the CTET exam:\n\n### 1. Familiarize Yourself with the Pattern\n\nThere are two sets of papers in the CTET exam: Paper I and Paper II. Paper I is for those who want to teach class 1 to Class V. Paper II is for those who want to teach class VI to class VIII. Candidates who want to teach at both levels will have to take both the papers. Each paper contains questions from 5 subjects, and the candidate will be given two and a half hours to complete the test. There is no negative marking.\n\n### 2. Familiarize Yourself with the Syllabus\n\nThe CBSE puts up a detailed syllabus of the CTET exam on its website. Read and understand it carefully. Compare the syllabus with the previous year’s question papers to understand the weightage carried by each of the topics.\n\n### 3. Understand the Question Format\n\nThe CBSE publishes a detailed note on how the questions appearing in the CTET exam will be designed and structured. Read and ensure that you understand each point clearly.\n\n### 4. Take CTET Mock Tests\n\nThis is one of the key tips on how to prepare for CTET exams. It is highly recommended that you take the online mock tests at regular intervals to understand your strengths and weaknesses. Taking a test is the best way to judge your mastery in a subject. It will also help you work on managing time during the actual exam. The CTET consists of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). You are expected to answer one question in one minute. The only way to increase your speed is through practice. There are some theoretical questions too. You must aim to attempt all questions within the given time, as there is no negative marking. For a clearer idea, head to Fair and Lovely Career Foundation’s website which has a [test section](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/en/online-tests/teaching/testbook/5aec5bba4de2937b6137c15e/tet) full of such practice tests that are sure to help with your preparation.\n\n### 5. Prepare a Schedule\n\nMake a detailed schedule to cover all the subjects. Take into account the time needed for taking mock tests and doing revisions. Break up difficult subjects into sections and topics to avoid getting overwhelmed. Be disciplined and stick to your schedule. Ensure that it also has sufficient time for you to take breaks and refresh your mind. It is important to not get overwhelmed during your preparation.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Tests, Teaching, Career in Teaching, CTET Preparation, CTET Mock Test, CTET Teaching Exam\n\n",

Here is everything about her.\n\nGunjan Saxena was born in 1972 in Bihar. Her family moved to Lucknow when she was a child, so she attended Kendriya Vidyalaya (a government school). Gunjan moved to Delhi to study electronics engineering at Indraprastha University. She loved the city and decided to stay here for good. In her spare time, she worked as an air hostess for a few years before pursuing her dream of becoming a pilot in the air force.\n\nIn 1994, the Indian Air Force called for women candidates to apply for the position of flying officer. Gunjan Saxena was selected from over 1,000 applicants and became the first female officer in her class. Gunjan passed out from IAF in 1994 with flying wings on both sides and was commissioned into the 'Flying Liner' corps of the IAF as a navigator-pilot officer after completing basic training at the College of Air Warfare (COAW) located at Pune Air Force Station (now known as Hindon Airbase). Gunjan Saxena became one of the first female pilot in the Indian Air Force (IAF) on June 27 1994. She had a very supportive family and was able to fly solo at age 16.\n\nShe flew helicopters from Chandigarh on her first solo flight and has been flying since then. She is also one of the few women who have flown Chetak and Cheetah helicopters.\n\nShe flew with her team of pilots to Srinagar, Kashmir, in 1996 as part of Operation Rakshak, which aimed at quelling violence there. In 1999, she was transferred back to Chandigarh and then again to Adampur in Punjab, where she stayed until 2002.\n\nWhile at Adampur, she was chosen by the Ministry of Defence to be part of a three-member team that would be deployed as UN peacekeepers in Congo as part of Operation Shikar. The mission involved building schools, hospitals and other infrastructure in war-torn areas. In 2002, she was sent abroad for training on how to fly fighter jets or supersonic aircraft. Gunjan was also part of a four-member team deployed to help restore power after an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010.\n\nGunjan Saxena, an Indian Air Force pilot, has made a name for herself as one of the first female pilots to fly combat missions. She is an inspiration for everyone who wants to aim for the sky. She has done many things that women were not allowed to do in the past. She's also a role model for all young girls out there who want to do something significant with their lives. You can be a pilot in the armed forces if you are willing to work hard and prove yourself through your skills.

She is also a social media influencer who is into make-up and beauty. She shares her journey and everything you need to know before taking up a career as an influencer. So let’s get some influencing done!**\n\n**Hello Anushka! It’s very nice of you to speak with us. Please tell us about yourself.**\n\nHi, I am Anushka; I completed my MBA in Human resources in 2020. I am currently doing a corporate job and simultaneously working as a social media influencer.\n\n**How did you start your career as a social media influencer?**\n\nI had got very interested in makeup and beauty some five-six years ago. Even during my MBA, I often used to think whether I should start my makeup vlog on social media, but I was pretty much uncertain about it.\n\n**When the covid pandemic happened, I could not get placed at any job. I was very stressed, and at that point, I decided to step into social media influencing.**\n\n**At first researched video editing, presentation, etc., and then uploaded just 2-3 videos. I had fun doing them. And was happy with the way they turned out.**\n\n**Surprisingly I got a good response from the people. I got motivated by the people’s support and appreciation. So I continued doing it and gradually became known as a beauty influencer.**\n\n**Very interesting! Anushka, if someone did not know about this field, how would you educate them?**\n\nIf you want to start a career as an influencer, proper research and practice are essential.\n\nFor example, if you are a girl who does not know anything about makeup, you must watch YouTube videos and start practising. Makeup is an art. And you master it by practising. Even I was terrible at makeup earlier. But I practised a lot.\n\nYou don’t need to enrol for expensive courses or training\n\nIf you are determined to do, you can also train yourself at your home! Consistency and patience are required; that’s it!\n\n**You have a full-time corporate job as an HR professional. And now you also work as a social media influencer. So tell me, how do you manage and organise your day?**\n\nOn the weekdays I am busy with my office work.\n\nBut on the weekends, I shoot and edit my vlogs. This way, my weekends are all about shooting and content creation which, of course, I love!\n\n**Tell us more about being a social influencer as a career opportunity**\n\nBeing an influencer is like a dream job! You can work from anywhere and at any time. There are no restrictions.\n\nAlso, many people support and praise us, which pushes us to work harder.\n\nIn fact, you get paid for what you love, and you need not take any particular degree or course to get into this career.\n\nYou need to make a bare minimum investment while starting as an influencer. A ring light, an android phone, or a camera if you have and you are done!\n\nI have always wanted to work with big brands. This dream of mine is accomplished by being an influencer! I have collaborated with the brands like Nykaa, Purplle Mac cosmetics, etc.\n\nAlso, the support of my social media followers is immense! So these are the things I will never forget.\n\nIn my view, being an influencer is not always very happy-go-lucky!\n\nThere will be hatred; there will be negative comments flowing out in the comment section of your page. A courageous person who can take all this more realistically can choose this career.\n\nAlso, if you only love doing something and start your vlog page and then stop when you get bored, it will not help. Continuation and the will to inspire people should be there inside you.\n\nMoreover, you need to learn skills like editing, presentation, shooting, etc. You should have that spark to learn things. Even I handle all the things by myself. In the end, people will watch you for 2-3 mins, and you should stand out and stick to their attention!\n\n**What is your message to the young girls out there?**\n\n**I see a lot of girls getting confused about their careers. I would say that go slow, analyse what you love.**\n\n** It could be dancing, singing, acting or anything! At some point in life, I loved makeup…I followed my passion, and today I am happy with what I do rather than being stressed out.**\n\nAnushka is genuinely inspiring, and this is why she is a successful influencer today.[ To read more such inspiring stories of successful girls, click here!](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/students-success-stories)\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Online Career Guidance, Free career guidance, INFLUENCER AS A CAREER OPTION, Career Options in India, Career Options For Women In India\n\n",

You can do so! Read on to know more about how.\n\nTo be fluent in a language, you have to be able to speak or write a language easily and correctly. You must have the confidence to speak, listen, read and write the language well.\n\n## Follow the tips mentioned below every week, and you will definitely see a major improvement in your English fluency.\n\n1. **Watch TV series in English or Listen to English audiobooks:**\n\nThe best way to become fluent in English is by listening to a native speaker speak in English. It is the most natural way to learn. Even children learn to talk via listening.\n\nYou can listen to an audiobook anywhere - while travelling, walking down the road, or lying on the bed. Listen to the sounds and pick up the pronunciation. With the help of contexts, you will be able to understand words better.\n\nWatching TV shows is also a great option. However, you are watching and listening here, so your concentration is divided.\n\nFollow these tips for listening to audiobooks:\n\n- Start by listening to short stories. They are easy to follow.\n- The first time you listen to them, it is recommended that you also read along with the story.\n- The next time, listen while doing any basic activity.\n- The third time you listen, pause after each sentence and try repeating it. Use the same pronunciation and speech patterns as best as you can. Repeat this step a couple of times\n\n1. **Read out loud:**\n\nRead your book aloud. 15 minutes a day will help in improving pronunciation. It also goes a great way in helping you understand grammar and sentence structure. Your vocabulary will also increase, as will your confidence.\n\n- Remember to start out reading slowly. There's no need to rush. Think about each word and try to make sense of the sentences as you read.\n- Open your mouth wide as you pronounce each word. This will help you speak more clearly. This is because it is tougher to make the sounds when you open your mouth as wide as possible when saying something out loud. Thus your brain thinks more carefully about the word. You don't have to do this forever. Once you are able to speak faster, you can stop.\n- Reading every day before bed is ideal.\n\n1. **Try to think in English: **\n\nThis might not seem easy at first. So here's a tip: Take a walk around and try to name everything around you. You don't have to start forming sentences from the very beginning. Start by thinking about the object. Slowly, you can increase the difficulty by making short sentences about the objects. Eventually, start talking to yourself in English. It helps increase clarity and gives you the confidence to speak in public.\n\n1. **Keep a diary:**\n\nThis is a slightly advanced step. Just open any book you can write in and write about anything you want. It is pretty similar to the thinking and speaking exercise. The difference is that you have to write it down.

Is it helpful to students? What about working people?\n\nA to-do list is a list of tasks you need to complete or things you want to do.\n\nTo figure out the importance of to-do lists, ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. Do you forget to do important work/projects?\n2. Do you struggle to maintain deadlines?\n3. Do people have to chase you down to get work done?\n4. Do you feel overwhelmed with large amounts of work?\n\n## You aren't alone. A to-do list will help you with all of these. It enables you to keep your life and work more organised.\n\n### How does a to-do list work?\n\nTraditionally written on a piece of paper, nowadays, there are various apps available to make them. These lists act as a memory aid. You can use them at home, at work or even in school. Typically, you note down the tasks in order of priority.\n\n### What are the benefits of creating a t-do list?\n\n1. You can find a list of all your tasks in one place. Hence, the chances of you forgetting an important task are very slim.\n2. Since you no longer have to remember tasks, your mind is free to focus on other things.\n3. Because you have already decided what you want to do and the order in which you want to do it, there is no anxiety or confusion later.\n4. It develops discipline.\n5. It gives you a sense of accomplishment.\n\n### How to make an effective to-do list?\n\n1. **Break down larger tasks into smaller ones:** These will help you break down tasks and make steady progress.\n2. **List down all your tasks and their deadlines:**** **This will help you decide which tasks to prioritise. It will also give you a rough idea of how much time you will take to complete each task.\n3. **Plan ahead: **Create your to-do list around your day. You know the work you have to do, and you know what your day looks like - fit your tasks alongside your schedule. If you know you have to pick up a sibling from school, can you complete anything from your list while waiting for them?\n4. **Schedule breaks:**** **This is important. Instead of taking a random break anytime between tasks, schedule a break every few tasks. You can use this to wind down and relax before you take up another task. Knowing you have a planned break will help deter your mind from wandering off. Keep telling yourself to focus on the task as there is a break soon.\n5. **Cross what's done off your list: **It gives you a sense of accomplishment and makes you feel closer to your goal. You feel more motivated knowing the end is close.\n6. **Don't panic about incomplete tasks:**** **If you don't manage to complete a task on time, it's okay. Re-evaluate and add them back to your list wherever you can. If this happens often, use it as a learning and allot yourself more time in the future.\n\nLooking for more such tips?

One of the most common reasons is the lack of monetary funds. If you want to pursue your education but are worried about the fees, the Indian government has your back. Many loan schemes are available, especially for women, to empower and encourage girls to continue studying. :\n\nThe first thing to remember is that every bank that provides loans requires collateral for lending above INR 7.5 Lakhs. Collateral is something of value that a lender demands as security. In many cases, most public banks offer education loans without any collateral.\n\n### Read on to know more about Education Loans\n\n1. **Central Bank of India Cent Vidyarthi** –\n\nThis is one of the best schemes for girls in India. If you are willing to pay collateral, there is no limit on the loan amount. However, suppose you don't wish to pay collateral. In such a situation, you can avail yourself of a maximum of INR 10 lakh to study in India and INR 20 lakh to study abroad. The interest rate for women belonging to the ST (Scheduled Tribe), SC (Scheduled Cast) IIT students is MCLR = 1.5%.\n\nThis loan covers most expenses, including:\n\n- School and college fees\n- Laboratory, library, exam fees.\n- Funds to buy books, uniforms and equipment\n- Hostel fees, travel expenses for education abroad.\n- Insurance of the student borrower.\n- Any course-related expense\n\n1. **Corp Vidya Scheme** – The Corporation Bank of India offers this loan at interest rate concessions to females.

With their determination, perseverance, and passion, women have come a long way in our country and are now set to change the startup landscape of India. In the world of business, which was majorly a man-driven industry, our women are growing by leaps and bounds. Not only are they making their mark in fashion, food/beverages and lifestyle industries, they are also penetrating into the technology and other sectors and doing great for themselves. As per statistics, of the total number of companies that got seed funding in India, more than 15% are founded by women. This might not sound like a great number, but it is an increase from what it was earlier.\n\n## Let’s take a look at some of the very significant female-founded startups in India and their founders:\n\n### 1.ShopClues-Radhika Ghai Aggarwal\n\nShopClues is an online marketplace selling everything from technology and fashion to footwear and jewelry.

After completing her MS in Management Science & Engineering from Stanford University, she worked at PayPal in San Jose, California as a product manager, before returning to India in 2008.\n\n### 3. Freshmenu- Rashmi Daga\n\nFreshMenu is a full-stack online kitchen that serves global cuisine right at your doorstep.

The range of the field is so vast. It covers language, culture, history, philosophy, sociology, music, visual arts and more. So, it's not surprising that finding the right course with a promising career opportunity after 12th grade is confusing. 'What Next?' is a fairly common question. Don't worry - a little bit of research can help you choose the right course.\n\n## This article is here to help you. Read on to know your options.\n\n1. **Bachelors of Arts (B.A.) **This is the most frequently chosen option. The reason is quite simple.

This is good because it increases your career options. Consider a student option for Psychology, Economics and Literature in the first year.

The salary range starts from 3L but can go up to 20L or more per annum.\n\n1. **Bachelor of Fashion Design**This is a 3-4 year course specialising in making garments, jewellery, accessories, and footwear.

Career-driven women are now working in fields like finance, technology, and even science. These were fields that were previously dominated by men.\n\nThere are no longer jobs meant for females or males; that's a thought that is slowly disappearing in society. Depending on the field you're passionate about, there are creative and non-traditional job opportunities available online.\n\nIf you are looking to start work and want to know about the kind of [career options](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options) that women pursue, here are your top options:\n\n## The 8 Best Career Options for Women In India\n\n1. **Marketing Jobs**\n\nIn the past, many people believed that women can't do marketing jobs. But now things are changing. Many women are exploring the field of marketing and like the job role.\n\nA Marketing job involves creating campaigns and strategies.

Graphic Designing\n\nGraphic Designing is another career option that is great for the creative side of your personality.\n\nIt's a very exciting job because you get to see your creative designs used on websites or advertisements in a magazine or on platforms like Instagram.\n\nBut for this job role, you'll have to learn how to make these designs on software. If you practice and learn how to use software like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, or Canva, you'll most certainly understand how it works.\n\nBut don't worry, you can learn how to design by taking online training courses on design and also watching videos on the Internet.\n\n------\n\n*If you are searching for job opportunities in any of the new and upcoming fields that women work in, you can consider joining the*[* Glow & Lovely Careers Community*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/sheroes-community)*.

Today, there is a huge demand for web developers who are experts in HTML and CSS because they tend to create cutting-edge and fashionable designs. **CSS style sheet** manages how the page's elements and contents look and are displayed. A uniform look and feel is created for all the pages using CSS.\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed and continues to manage CSS. It was initially made available on December 17, 1996. To add/enforce the new feature / specifications in all browsers, the CSS Working Group is currently collaborating with various browser vendors. The content and presentation can be separated using CSS. This division offers a great deal of flexibility and control over how the website must appear. This is the primary benefit of CSS.\n\nThe 3rd version of the CSS standard, CSS3 or Cascading Style Sheets Level 3, is used to design and format web pages. CSS2 is incorporated into CSS3, along with some upgrades. The division of standards into various modules, which makes CSS3 simpler to learn and comprehend, is the primary change in CSS3.\n\n## To become a web designer, candidates must succeed in interviews.

Why did CSS have to be created?\n\n11. How are a class and an ID different from one another?\n\n### Interview questions for intermediate CSS:\n\n1. Define z-index first.\n\n2. What advantages do CSS Sprites offer?\n\n3. How can you style both h3 and h2 targets similarly?\n\n4. List the media types that CSS supports.\n\n5. How can CSS be used to limit the repetition of images?\n\n6. What can you tell us about the property that controls image scrolling?\n\n7. List a few font-related CSS properties.\n\n8. Contextual selectors should be defined.\n\n9. Describe how responsive web design works.\n\n10. Describe the CSS nomenclature in general.\n\n11. What are CSS's restrictions?\n\n12. How can CSS be incorporated into a webpage?\n\n13. What various CSS selector types are there?\n\n14. What is a CSS Pre-processor? Why do people use Sass, Less, and Stylus?\n\n15. What does CSS's VH/VW (viewport height/viewport width) property mean?\n\n16. What is the difference between resetting and normalising CSS? What distinguishes them from one another?\n\nYour interviewer will likely ask you these questions. Give thoughtful, complete responses. For your preparation, you can also check out **HTML-CSS** training. A thorough knowledge of **cascading style sheets in HTML **would help you ace your interview.

People must stand out to get noticed, especially with hundreds of others vying for the same position. The skill sets that were once considered the latest need to be updated. Jobs are evolving, and new roles are being invented daily. Therefore, the need to upskill and reskill is higher than ever before. Today, every job requires you to understand the **meaning of technical skills** specific to that industry.\n\n## Technical skills - what does it mean?\n\nWhile soft skills are essential in the workplace, knowledge of technical skills is also necessary. Technical skills are the knowledge and abilities required to complete specific digital or physical tasks. **Technical skills** are also known as hard skills. These are acquired through education or hands-on experience.\n\nEmployers often seek a combination of technical and soft skills in their prospective employees. In 2023, to succeed in your respective field, you need to develop and possess both soft skills as well as technical skills.\n\n### Technical skills in employees\n\nThe **technical skills** you must have to conduct your job efficiently depend on your industry. Here is a list of a few basic skills that can benefit you, no matter the industry.\n\n- Database management\n- Knowledge of Company software\n- Project management\n- Customer service systems\n- Corporate communications\n- IT security\n- Data analysis\n- Social media management\n\nHaving technical knowledge increases your productivity and helps your overall development. It further increases self-confidence and competencies, enabling you to reach your goals faster.\n\n### Technical skills in managers:\n\nManagers often prioritise their soft skills above their technical abilities. However, more than just soft skills are needed for today's managers. Applying **technical skills in management** along with soft skills can help you reach your full potential. You will be able to be more productive while getting the most out of your employees.\n\n#### Here are some common technical skills that are required across several industries:\n\n1. **Digital & IT Skills: **Every manager should have some **technical knowledge**. Operating email, video conferencing, project management software, etc., can help you stay connected to your team. These are critical while handling remote or hybrid units.\n2. **Researching: **An ocean of information is available on the internet, but as a manager, you need to know how to find relevant information, assess its accuracy, and apply it to your situation. Failing to do so can affect your productivity.\n3. **Data Analysis Skills: **Data analysis abilities enable you to evaluate and apply information and make sound choices for your team.\n4. **Administrative and office skills: **As a manager, you should be able to manage time, communication, and information. It would help if you were well-versed in office software and other programs. Apart from the above, a manager should also have some knowledge of programming, bookkeeping, billing, the ability to work with media, project planning and budgeting, to name a few.\n\nPossessing technical skills is increasingly becoming important for both employees and managers alike.**[Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) provides excellent tips, [courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) and [guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) to enhance your technical skills & technical knowledge**.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** technical skills, technical skills meaning, technical knowledge, technical skills in management, Online Courses\n\n",

You can look forward to having a secure career by working for the government.\n\n## With a government job, there are many benefits such as:\n\n- Security Of Job\n- Steady Income\n- Medical Benefits\n- Retirement Bonuses\n\n**Banking, railways, defense, and police are some of the most popular government departments to work for, among others.**\n\nEach department has its own committee that conducts the examination to hire people to work for them.

Here are the names of those exams:\n\n### CAPF (Central Armed Police Forces) Exam\n\nThis exam has 3 categories: written, physical, and an interview to judge the candidate’s personality.\n\nThere are physical standards that must be met to pass the physical category test for this exam. This is mainly because the job role involves being part of security operations.\n\nThe basic pay for the starting role in this job is Rs. 15,600.\n\n**Registration for the CAPF exam - begins roughly on 20th April 2022.**\n\n### NDA (National Defence Academy) Exam\n\nThe NDA exam is the one to prepare for when you wish to get a job in the Army, Navy, or the Air Force.

It is the central bank of India that manages other banks. **It is also a great opportunity to learn more about working in the bank sector.**\n\nIf you’re interested in working in any of the RBI offices, passing the RBI Assistant Exam gives you this opportunity.\n\nAn RBI Assistant’s role includes data entry, verifying bank documents, generating reports, and other entry-level tasks at an RBI branch office.\n\nAn RBI Assistant earns a basic salary of Rs. 14,650, and promotions are possible depending on how well the candidate is.\n\nRegistration for the RBI Assistant exam happens in the month of January. You can practice for the exam by taking RBI mock exams to score well.\n\n### SBI PO (Probationary Officer) Exam\n\nAnother important exam that can help you build a career in Banking are the exams conducted by the State Bank Of India.\n\nSBI is a government bank, and every year, they conduct an exam for the role of a Probationary Officer (PO).\n\nThe post of a PO is an entry-level job at an SBI bank branch. As a PO, you get intensive training for 2 years and an attractive promotion if you work well. Depending on how well a job is done, you can even get promoted to the post of Bank Manager. You can earn a salary in the range of Rs. 38,000 to Rs. 42,000 as an SBI Bank PO.\n\nThe SBI PO exam is usually conducted in the month of January of the year, but it can change due to the pandemic.\n\nThis is why it’s best to check the SBI website once to apply and confirm exam dates.\n\n### IBPS (Institute Of Banking Personnel Selection) Exams\n\nThe IBPS exams were started with the aim to make it easier for students to get jobs in government-owned banks in India. So, if you want to get into a public sector bank in India other than SBI or RBI, then IBPS exams help you get there.\n\nSome of the banks that are within the IBPS category are:\n\n- Punjab National Bank\n- Bank Of Maharashtra\n- Union Bank Of India\n- Bank of Baroda\n- Canara Bank\n\nSome of these banks also organise pre-examination training, which you can attend so that you score well on the exams. In case you can’t attend the training, you can always take mock tests online to practice for the exam.\n\n### IBPS SO (Specialist Officer) Exam\n\nOne of the big exams conducted by IBPS is for the post of Specialist Officer in a public sector bank.\n\nA specialist officer is a candidate hired simply because they specialise in a field that’s not directly connected to banking.\n\nFor example, an I.T. officer is an expert in technology. This means that technology is the fixed department that the individual specialises in. And many banks need someone with an I.T. background to help them provide technology-friendly services to their customers.\n\nPublic banks are in need of people with a background in different fields and not just banking. This is why the IBPS SO exam is a chance for candidates with backgrounds in fields like I.T., Marketing, HR, or even Law to get a post in banks.\n\nThe basic pay of an IBPS SO is Rs. 23,700 a month.\n\nThe IBPS exams are scheduled to happen in December 2021.\n\nDo check the IBPS website for regular updates on the exam so that you can prepare for them.\n\nUPSC (Union Public Service Commission) Exam\n\n### The IAS (Indian Administrative Service Exam)\n\nAmong the exams conducted by UPSC, the most sought-after exam to give is the IAS. To become an IAS officer is a dream that many students work towards. It’s claimed to be the toughest exam to crack in India.\n\nThere are several perks to becoming an IAS officer, such as lifetime pension, a house, and job stability. The job comes with its share of responsibilities and a very respectable post to get.\n\nSome duties of an IAS officer are:\n\n- Disbursement of funds\n- Maintaining law and order\n- Collecting revenue\n- Making sure policies are implemented\n\nTo become an IAS officer, you have to first clear the CSE (Civil Services Exam). The CSE is a year-long exam that happens in 3 stages, and 1000+ candidates get selected. After that, you can attempt the IAS exam depending on the rank you get in CSE.\n\nThe IAS exam is scheduled to happen in October 2021.\n\nThe basic salary of an IAS officer is Rs. 56,100 a month, and there are several additional benefits too.\n\n*Also Read: *[*5 IAS women officers who are a source of inspiration to Indian girls*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/blog/5-ias-women-officers-who-are-source-inspiration-indian-girls-230)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis list should help you understand the top upcoming government exams to prepare for.

You will find it in the majority of offices and personal computers. Having a good knowledge of using Microsoft Word will make you stand out during job interviews.\n\nWondering how to learn MS Word? The FAL Foundation has a [free online course, Office Productivity Tools](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/en/course-detail/niit-106/office-productivity-tools:-mso-word-2010): MSO Word 2010. You can think of it as a Microsoft Word Tutorial for beginners. The course will help you learn the basics like creating and editing word files, adding images and tables in your Word documents, printing your files, etc.\n\nBeing fluent with Microsoft Word has many benefits. It is one of the most used software. From school students to office goers, you’ll find that everyone needs to use Microsoft Word for one thing or the other.\n\nTyping on a Word file is easy and convenient. All the options to format and save your file are at the top of the document on a blue panel. Every function on the panel is explained visually. You have to take your mouse cursor on an icon to see what it does. To use the function, you have to click on that icon.\n\nYou can correct your mistakes in seconds using the delete button. You can format your text; place it in the center or the margins of the page with a single click. There is also a spelling and grammar check, which points out any typing or grammar mistakes. If your document contains bullets and numbers, Word puts the bullets on its own.\n\nAnd how can we forget the Thesaurus feature? In written presentations and assignments, word choice matters a lot. Microsoft Word’s Thesaurus will help you choose the right words to communicate your ideas. Sometimes, it’s not just about what you are saying, but also how you are saying it. Using the right words is one of the crucial tips for improving your presentation skills. However, a good presentation needs more than blocks of text. Whenever possible, you must explain your points using images and graphs. You can insert pictures and draw diagrams in your word document with the click of a button. There’s also an option to format your page layout to make it look more appealing and easier to read.\n\nThe Microsoft Word allows you to add colors and play with font sizes. Use this to highlight the more important points of your presentation. You can also use a separate color for headers in your document or add borders and Clip Art. It will break the monotonous look of your Word presentation and make it more readable.\n\nThat’s not all. The Microsoft Word offers template designs that can be used to create a huge number of documents like a Calendar or Greeting Card. You can save your file in a variety of formats including a web page.\n\nIntegrating Word File with other Microsoft Office Programs is easy. For example, if you want to include a table from an Excel Sheet in your Word Document, you can do so using the Paste option. You do not have to convert the document or file. This saves a lot of time in the long run.\n\nIf you are still unsure about enrolling for such a course, please understand that in this day and age, having a proper understanding and use of tools like Microsoft Word is an absolute must for any individual. The use of knowledge of these skills extends beyond the workplace and can come in handy at your home too.

She had never seen city life. She did not even have a television in her house.\n\nNone of these things could stop her. Today, Vaishali is a successful designer who has her fashion boutiques. She is also the first Indian woman designer to present her designs at the Paris Fashion Week.\n\nWith her collection ‘SHWAS’ that means ‘breath’. She was the first woman designer and an international guest designer invited by the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode to showcase their brand’s couture collection at the event.\n\n## From a small-town teen to a well-known fashion designer\n\nVaishali gathered all her savings, and with a loan of Rs 50,000, she opened her first boutique in Mumbai.\n\nWithin ten years, Vaishali opened two more boutiques, completed her graduation, and then even post-graduation in fashion!\n\n### Second-hand clothes: The first step towards a successful career in designing\n\nAs a child, Vaishali rarely got to wear new clothes. Most of her clothes were old. Worn by her elder sister and then passed down to Vaishali when they became old.\n\nOnce they were of no use, her parents used to recycle them. Vaishali’s family tried to save money. All that could be used again was reused or recycled.\n\nNot a single cloth at her home was wasted. They made curtains and tablecloths from these old clothes. This creative and intelligent way of recycling clothes and designing something new from them was Vaishali’s first-ever inspiration for designing – Something she would later build her career based on this idea.\n\n### Clothes in her backpack and beautiful dreams in her eyes.\n\nVaishali realised that she could not achieve her dreams by staying in the village.\n\nSo she left her house and went to Bhopal. All she had with her was a backpack of clothes and dreams in her eyes.\n\nShe stayed at the hostel and took a job at a builder’s office as an office assistant.\n\nWhile working, she used to give fashion advice to her colleagues. She saw that people liked what she suggested. Some used to come back to her and thank her for her advice. This motivated her to think about fashion designing as a career option.\n\nVaishali knew that just giving advice or having basic knowledge of fashion wouldn’t do her any good. She needed to have a proper education and degree to move ahead. But money was still an issue.\n\nVaishali was a dream chaser, though. She smartly handled this situation. Instead of enrolling in a college, she photocopied the whole curriculum.\n\nShe started studying at home by herself. Simultaneously, she also started designing on a small scale.\n\nShe saved some money and shifted from Bhopal to Mumbai for better opportunities.\n\nHere she took up took a job at a gym. Along with that, she worked at an export house as a designer. Soon with her savings and a loan of Rs 50,000, Vaishali started her own fashion designing business. Soon her work started gaining fame. She also got a chance to present at Lakme and New York Fashion Week.\n\nEven after achieving success, Vaishali still has more dreams and ambitions. According to her, the current success is just the beginning. “I am just getting started!” she says!\n\n* Like Vaishali, many girls wish to take up fashion designing as their career option.

To learn more about online courses in detail visit Glow & Lovely Careers.\n**Meta Keywords:** online courses for women, courses for girls, free online courses, online courses for educators\n\n**Page Title:** The Value and Benefits of Online Courses Learning to Educators and Teachers\n\n**Date:** 09th Jun 2021\n**Read Time:** 7 min read0.0 / 5\n\n**Banner Image:** ![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/hero-image/2022-09/E-LEARNING2.jpg \"Online Courses\")\n\n**Article Content:**\n\nWith the Pandemic, we saw the whole world shifting online and going digital. From buying groceries to having classes for kids – everything was done online.\n\nWith the vaccine, the Pandemic will go away. But the world shifting online is here to stay.\n\nIn the past few years, online education and online courses have become very prominent. These courses are beneficial for both students and teachers alike.\n\nEven before one opts for courses, there are online tests to understand one’s liking and knowledge of a particular subject or interest area. These tests are beneficial for both students and teachers.\n\n## Online tests and their benefits – For teachers as well as their students\n\nThere are [free psychometric tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) that help students with shortlisting career options as per their choice. It is a good idea for teachers and educators to recommend students to opt for such career planning tests to give them more focused guidance on their careers. These tests can be given online or there are options to give it in person.\n\nThere are also test series for entrance test for teachers. These are mock tests for those who are interested in applying for government teaching jobs. There is an entrance test to be given to be eligible for teaching jobs. It is called as TET – Teacher Eligibility Test. One can give free online [mock tests for TET](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-tests/teaching/testbook/5aec5bba4de2937b6137c15e/tet) to be better prepared for the actual exam.\n\n## Online Courses and Job Opportunities for Tuition Teachers\n\nThere are also certificate courses for tuition teachers such as WONK. WONK is India’s largest expert tutor booking app with 75,000+ tutors. It trains and certifies tuition teachers so that parents are assured about getting quality teaching services for their children. On average WONK Tutors earn INR 40,000 per month.\n\nThe best part about WONK is that it helps provide part-time job opportunities and work from home options to those teachers who are looking at career options with flexible timings.\n\nOnline learning and online courses are beneficial for teachers and educators. If you are a teacher or an educator, here are a few reasons why you can consider online learning and online courses:\n\n### NEP 2020 and Online Education\n\nThe focus of the NEP seems to be on vocational courses and life skills.\n\nWhile there are many institutions that offer coaching these courses in person, online courses make it easy for teachers to upgrade their skills.\n\nUGC (University Grants Commission) has issued a notice that institutions can offer up to 40% of courses in a particular programme in a semester through online learning platforms such as Swayam.\n\nThis will open new opportunities for teachers in the online teaching field.\n\n## Free Online courses is a great option for Teachers. Certification is a bonus\n\n**Why opt for free courses if there are paid available**: If one is learning something new, a free online course is better than a paid course. A free course allows one to explore multiple subjects that the teacher may want to learn. It is a risk-free trial of different courses simultaneously.\n\nFrom Science and Coding, to beauty and wellness, to Engineering, Manufacturing, Law and Finance, we have an extensive list of free online courses with certification for women on this website. Do have a look to check out the courses which may be of interest to you. The idea is to make education and progress available to all!\n\nIt allows one to explore multiple courses at the same time. The courses which one likes, can be completed. The rest of the courses can be left mid-way. Since these are not paid courses, there is no guilt or pressure to complete the course\n\n**Why are free certificate courses important**: Certification lends authenticity and credibility to what is learnt. It adds weight to the CV. It shows the person has taken the effort to study, attend classes, appear for an exam to get a certificate. Certificates not only show the authenticity of the subject learnt but also reflect positively on the character of the person obtaining the certificate. There is thus merit in going for free online courses that offer a certificate.\n\n### How can learning online courses benefit teachers and educators?\n\n- Easy revision of subjects\n\nOnline courses help teachers stay updated with what is happening around them. It also helps them brush up on what they already know – like a revision of their expertise and knowledge.\n\nFor example, an English teacher may want to upgrade his or her knowledge in English, list down the common mistakes that students usually make and share that list with students.\n\nIn such a case, the teacher can always use a short, free, [online course on common mistakes in English](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/englishedge-906/common-mistakes-in-english). This will help revising the common mistakes that someone can make in English. The teacher can then share these learnings with their students too.\n\nSimilarly, a management professor wants to revise his or her knowledge before teaching the students basics of management or how to build and implement a new business model. In this case, the teacher can opt for a free online course to build a new [business model implementation](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/edx-delftx+bmi.4x/business-model-implementation).\n\n- Learning new subjects and upgrading existing knowledge\n\nThe world around us is changing at a rapid speed. This makes us all feel that we need to learn new things to keep up with the world.\n\nOnline courses are an easy way to keep learning new things. For example, a Hindi teacher may want to learn how to speak English more efficiently. There are free online courses to [learn English from Hindi](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/helloenglish-1/learn-english-from-hindi)[ ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/helloenglish-1/learn-english-from-hindi)\n\nOr there could be an IT teacher who wants to learn Python programming. Free online courses on Python data structures, computation thinking with Python or just a basic course on Python programming may be a great way to start learning the subject.\n\nTeachers and educators keep interacting with the younger generation everyday. They too need to be updated, know different subjects and develop new skills to keep up with the students around them.\n\n#### Interdisciplinary learning:\n\nGone are the days when a teacher teaching commerce could only learn finance and an arts teacher could not learn science.\n\nToday, it is all about learning different subjects and using those learnings effectively. For example, Steve Jobs used his knowledge of designing and calligraphy along with computer engineering to give the world Apple computers.\n\nSimilarly, a person who knows computer science may wish to [learn English](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=english) better to come up with a program like Google Translate – which allows one to translate one language into another using the program.\n\nFree Online courses are a great way to keep learning about different subjects.\n\n### Flexibility of time and location\n\nTeachers and educators are usually busy. It is difficult for them to enroll in a college or attend lectures and classes to learn new things.\n\nOnline courses offer flexibility. One can learn where ever one wants to and at whatever time one wants to.\n\n#### More Opportunities\n\nLearning new subjects or gaining more knowledge in an existing subject opens doors for many opportunities.\n\nSometimes it could be a simple course on Personality development and grooming or a course on how to crack interviews that may help the teachers boost their job opportunities.\n\nNEP 2020 has also proposed tie ups with foreign colleges. It is, therefore, a good idea to keep yourself updated so as to be prepared when a new job or career opportunities crop up.\n\n#### Wider Student base\n\nLearning new subjects also help widen the student base of the teachers. As one learns more, there is more that the teacher can teach the students – automatically helping increase the number of students.\n\nTake WONK for example. As a WONK certified teacher, you get access to many more job opportunities as per your needs.\n\nOnline education has also opened doors to more locations. One is not bound by physical boundaries anymore. You may be sitting in Assam and teaching in the United States of America. Or living in South India can conducting classes for Delhi students.\n\nOnline courses help one prepare better for these kinds of changing scenarios.\n\n## Virtual classrooms and workshops are a good idea for educators to consider too\n\nOnline courses is not just about teachers opting to learn different subjects. It is also about teachers helping students learn from any location.\n\nVirtual classrooms is a good idea to have interaction with students. It works better than a correspondence course where the students have to read textbooks and understand concepts on their own.\n\nThe teachers could also combine correspondence courses with one-day workshops to help answer student queries.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Learn English, English Online Courses, Online English course, Education and Training, English learning course\n\n",

You can freelance in almost any field and make a good living for yourself. One such field is video editing. Due to the lockdown, the video content industry has experienced a boom. Video-viewing is at an all-time high, one of the biggest reasons for the high demand for video editors. And for now, it seems, this demand is here to stay.\n\n### What does a video editor do?\n\nIn simple words, a video editor takes a whole lot of video content and puts it in a flow that tells an engaging story. Primarily video content is created via specific video shoots. This content goes to video editors, who add sound, effects, animations, colour correction and more to the video. Thus, creating a visually appealing video that gets published for final viewer consumption. Sometimes, as in the case of cartoons and green screen shoots, video editors may require animating the entire landscape, including the characters, to create a captivating storyline.\n\nVideo editing is a broad industry. However, the following five significant branches suit freelancers the best. Read carefully to know the details of the roles and the sectors which require this skillset.\n\n### Web/Digital Marketing Video Editors\n\nThey work on videos that are short in length meant for viewing on the internet. These videos can be for small influencers or for big brands. You can freelance for an agency or directly for the client, depending upon your creativity and experience. These projects can be annual, monthly or weekly.\n\nTypical salary: ₹15,000 - ₹2,00,000+ per month\n\n### Event Video Editors\n\nThey work on videos for small events like parties or household-level celebrations. They also deal with more significant properties like award functions, weddings, corporate events and more. Most of these events require videos to capture the essence of the occasion in a long-form or short-form. It is a lucrative sector where one can build their niche quickly.\n\nTypical earnings : ₹2,000 - ₹1,50,000 per video\n\n### Film Editors\n\nUsually, a film director shoots enough and more relevant scenes from various angles to convey the correct story to the audience.

Be it business, education, health, politics, finance, science, etc.; she is constantly evolving and reaching newer heights at regional, national and global levels. People tend to look up to such women for inspiration and motivation. However, organisational norms and culture can influence her leadership style and behaviour. This often leads to suppressing one's values and style, which could impact her productivity.\n\n## Hence it is crucial to lead with a unique style and become an authentic leader.\n\n### What does Authentic leadership mean?\n\n**Authentic leadership** is when leaders behave genuinely and always stay true to who they are, no matter the circumstances.

Here's what you can do to lead more authentically.\n\n### Be Self-Aware\n\nDelve into yourself. Find out your strengths and weaknesses, values, likes and dislikes—things that are important to you and things you want to change. Self-understanding is the critical component of behaving and leading authentically. Set aside time to reflect and learn more about yourself.\n\n### Assess and Evaluate\n\nOnce you become aware of your strengths and weaknesses, you will be in a better position to align your behaviour with your beliefs. Focus on what you have given up, what is most important to you and what you want. What you decide could change at various points in your life. Set goals for yourself, and ensure they align with your values.\n\n### Act\n\nOnce your goals are set, act upon them. Change doesn't happen overnight; take time to introduce these changes. Take small steps to align your behaviour with your most important values. You may focus more on your well-being, for which you may cut back on your work time. It may affect your job performance, but focusing on yourself could make you more resilient and help you become a more productive woman leader.\n\n### Seek support\n\nAsking family and friends to help you in your journey to becoming an authentic woman leader can help you achieve your goals faster.

On account of changing lifestyles of people and growing awareness about health care, this industry is seeing considerable growth and is also creating a lot of job opportunities. There are multiple job options that suit women's needs and aspirations within healthcare. Here are a few jobs in the healthcare industry that women would be interested in:\n\n### Registered Nurse\n\nNurses are the backbone of the healthcare industry. For this reason, there is a huge demand for competent, qualified, and compassionate professionals to step into the nursing world. The duties of a nurse include providing direct patient care, assessing a patient's condition, recording patient’s medical data, administering treatments and medication as prescribed by a physician, performing diagnostic tests and educating patients and their families on follow-up care. Women have a natural instinct to take care of others. Hence, nursing jobs tend to be dominated by women and hpsitals, clinics and nursing homes have a positive attitude towards hiring women for nursing roles.\n\n### Physician\n\nOn account of the diverse skills that women possess - technical and soft skills - the job of a physician or doctor - general or specialized- would suit them very well. Some physicians, especially those who specialise in obstetrics or emergency care, may have to work long hours and may also be called to work at odd hours in the night. However, these are minor issues compared to the benefits of being a physician which include high job satisfaction, good remuneration, scope for self-employment, multiple opportunities for learning and professional growth. In terms of suceeding in the role, women are equally competent in terms of technical skills and they tend to be better than men at listening to patients, demonstrating empathy and concern and communicating with patients and their families.\n\n### Pharmaceutical Sales or Medical Representative\n\nYou must have come across a lot of men doing this job, but very few women. However, what most women don't realize is that many jobs in pharmaceutical sales provide excellent benefits and a great degree of flexibility in schedules. Some medical representative roles also allow employees to work part-time.These jobs allow women a chance to explore the highly remunerative world of pharmaceutical or drug sales which offers very compensation packages and good sales incentives. Many women are natural networkers and to succeed in this role they will get a chance to use their networking skills to meet, communicate with and cultivate a network of medical professionals.\n\n### Work-from-Home Medical Jobs\n\nToday, technology has developed to allow women to take up work-from-home medical jobs that allow them to earn as well as take care of family. This is especially beneficial for new mothers. Within healthcare, jobs that require a lot of computer and phone work lend themselves to working from home. Some of these include - medical transcription, medical (technical) writing, and healthcare recruiting.\n\n### Dentists\n\nThese days, almost half the number of students in dental colleges are women. Women consider this to be a suitable job as it it does not demand working at odd hours of the day and the qualification allows them to set up independent clinics close to home with very little investment. Dental medicine or Orthodontics is also a growing field thanks to increasing awareness about the importance of oral health. WIthin dentistry, there are further specializations such as pediatric (kids) dentistry that a lot of women opt for and have a natural advantage in providing.\n\nThe Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) provides a[ free online career guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) resources and tests so that you can explore various careers available within the health care industry to understand what you would enjoy doing.

We came across numerous movements started by women across the globe towards making the world a better place for them to live in. One of the most important areas of concern is the empowerment of women at work. It is a well-known fact that women around the world are facing different kinds of issues at work ranging from the gender pay gap, harassment, career opportunities and more. Globally the wage gap between women and men is around 57%. Only 22% of managerial positions worldwide are currently occupied by women. In the wake of this situation, many companies have started taking initiatives and making policies to combat these trends and make it more comfortable for women in the workplace.\n\n## Let’s read more on what different companies are doing in this regard.\n\n### Closing the gender pay gap\n\nCompanies like Adobe and Kellogg India have taken commendable measures to alleviate the gender pay gap. Adobe signed the ‘Equal Pay Pledge’ two years ago with companies including Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft, and the pledge read as follows:\n\nAdobe is proud to join the list of companies committed to equal pay. Paychecks are important, not only because they cover the needs of employees and their families, but also because they are an important indicator of fair treatment. Gender should have no part in driving pay decisions.\n\nAdobe has stayed true to this pledge and has achieved 100% pay parity in the information technology sector (IT). The company believes that women play multiple roles in their lives and their strengths and styles bring a different set of advantages to the table. They should be given due regard to this fact and rewarded equally as men.\n\n### Giving women equal responsibilities as men\n\nCompanies have started hiring more women into their talent pool and giving them responsibilities equal to men. The management at Indigo has started a few mentoring initiatives including a women executive shadow programme and Lean In circles, a voluntary peer group initiative. The Indigo management says that they celebrate ‘pilots’ and not ‘women pilots’, and applaud managers, not “lady managers”. Indigo has been hiring many women professionals and today women constitute 43% their workforce. The company has nearly a third of our managers and above positions are held by women, and a fourth of their leadership positions are held by women too. This shows that companies like Indigo are making efforts to give more opportunities to women.\n\n### Taking strict measures against sexual harassment\n\nSexual harassment of women has been a topic of heavy discussion this year. With the #MeToo movement many women across the world have come forward talking about sexual advancement my colleagues and superiors. In the wake of this situation, many companies have come up with special training and policies to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.

Having a portfolio is highly beneficial. It lets you market yourself to potential clients and employers. When applying for a job, a portfolio can help showcase your work, skills, and talent - all in one place. This is why it is essential that you put effort into carefully making a portfolio that shows you off in the best way possible.\n\n### How to make a good portfolio?\n\nAn ideal portfolio needs to have a collection of your work samples. These samples need to highlight your strength and talent. It needs to show work that you are proud of. However, ensure that your portfolio doesn't contain too much unnecessary content information that can lead to confusion.\n\nNow let's move on to the content in your creative portfolio. Read on to know how to make your portfolio stand out amongst others. Here are five ways you can improve your portfolio.\n\n1. **Showcase your best work!** Your portfolio needs to have quality over quantity. Don't include everything that you have worked on. Instead, focus on your best achievements. You can include ones that are unique or have won awards. Make sure that these showcase your talent and skillset. Do not put random, unrelated work. You can add personal work as well, provided it is relevant.\n2. **Make it interesting!** You want your client/employer to keep reading your portfolio. If it doesn't flow well or is unclear, this will not happen. Focus on the big picture. It is all well and good to go into details of each work you add to your portfolio. But it needs to look good and flow well overall. Hence, in addition to showing your best work, you can add your thought process or maybe steps you took to achieve the final result. This will provide some clarity and boast about your work style and ethics. Use high-resolution content. Add an explanation on the side about your role in creating the respective content.\n3. **Show diversity.** Your portfolio needs to show all of your skills, not just one. If all your work looks too similar, the client may think you are good at only one type of project/aesthetic. It could seem like your creativity is limited. Opt for variety. Mix and match and ensure your capabilities stand out.\n4. **Keep updating your portfolio.** Your portfolio needs to be up-to-date. Ideally, update it every couple of months or after a significant project, you would like to add. The sooner you do it, the better is your recollection of the content. Thus, you will be able to add relevant details about the project better. It would also help you not get overwhelmed. Additionally, you will not have to scramble to dig up old content every time you apply for a new job. If the client sees no newer content, they could assume you haven't done anything notable recently.\n5. **Add your contact details.** Adding your contact details simplifies the follow-up process. You can also add your CV and mission statement.\n\nNow that you know how to make a portfolio - get started on making one and apply for that job you want!

It is vital to obtain your degree from an institution or college recognised by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.\n\nYour typical course will teach you about fabrics, draping, lines and patterns, textures movement, colour etc., in context to the human form.

It depends upon your talent, the type of fashion designer you are, your clientele, and the geographical area from where you are operating. Factors like whether you are an individual brand, a freelancer or working for a fashion house affect your income.\n\nFor example, Sabhya Sachi, a leading designer in Indian wedding wear, sells sarees starting from approx Rs. 50,000 to upwards of Rs. 10,00,000 lakhs. In Connaught Place, Delhi, a lesser-known fashion designer sells his version of bridal fashion for prices starting at Rs. 3000.\n\nIf you are still unsure about being a fashion designer, here's something that can give you clarity.

To do this, a PR professional interacts with people who work for the news, radio or magazines.\n\nWhen you work in PR, you have to make contacts in the media. You also have to talk to many people who can promote the company you work for. That’s why this industry is great for women with good networking skills.\n\nThe work in PR is similar to those of marketing and advertising since these industries are largely connected.\n\n## But some responsibilities are mostly done only by Public Relations professionals, so let’s go over those -\n\n1. Make Others Aware Of The Brand, Product Or Company\n\nPR professionals are in charge of sharing the story of the brand or company they work for with millions of people.\n\nFor instance, if you work for a hotel, as a PR professional, you will have to communicate with YouTubers.

Body positivity is for everyone. It's not just for young people, older people, or men and women—it's for people of all races and sizes. It's about respecting other people's bodies, no matter their shape or size. Body positivity is all about loving your body just the way it is right now - you may have curves or thin arms or legs; whatever makes you feel good about yourself is valid!\n\n## There are several essential steps to learn how to be body positive.\n\n- Recognize that you are unique.\n- Accept yourself for who you are.\n- Think about how you want to feel instead of what other people think of your body or what society says is \"normal.\"\n- Embrace the things that make you different from others—you may have a different skin colour than the other people in your life. But it doesn't mean those differences aren't beautiful!\n- Focus on the positive aspects of your body instead of what's wrong with it (or not). This can help improve self-esteem and acceptance if done regularly over time.\n\nThe body positivity movement has been growing over the past decade. But it wasn't always this way: before this time, many people didn't see having a healthy body image as something they should strive for or even think twice about. Many studies show that an unhealthy mindset towards one's appearance can lead to anxiety, depression and other mental health issues.\n\nSelf-love and body image are essential parts of the body positivity movement. Self-love is integral to being your best self because it helps you feel good about yourself and your life. Body image is also a reflection of how you feel about yourself. If someone has low self-esteem, they may feel unattractive in their mind (even though they might look like a model on the outside). This can lead to poor decisions when it comes down to choosing what clothes/shoes/etc., fit their personal style best!\n\nIn conclusion, Body positivity involves three steps.

Each work of art in the collection is unique and has its own price.\n\nLike a piece of art, an NFT can be sold for either crypto or cash. But, just like with bitcoin, the asset transfer for the token is recorded in the blockchain. This shows who the owner of a certain NFT is. NFTs are digital works that have been turned into securities, such as famous videos, paintings, memes, and so on. This tokenized work of art comes with a unique digital ownership certificate that can be sold or bought online. Blockchain technology is what makes them work, just like cryptocurrency.\n\nEach NFT is linked to the digital or, in some cases, a physical asset of the original owner. Technically, you can turn any digital object into an NFT. The great thing about NFTs is that anyone can make them out of famous tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram photos, and more and sell them.\n\nYou might be wondering why people spend so much money on something that can't be seen or touched, like NFTs. You may also be wondering how people make money from NFTs since they are just pictures. We'll talk more about that below.\n\nThe value of an NFT is based on how interested consumers are in it, just like it is with the works in our made-up art collection. Just like with trading cards, their value is mainly based on how rare they are and how many people want to buy them.\n\nEven though an image can be turned into an NFT, there is no rule that says it can't be copied or shared. But the blockchain stores and makes it clear who owns the asset. This makes it impossible to fake who owns NFTs. One of the main things that drive its value is the happy feeling of being the only owner. Most of the time, people make money and increase the value of their NFTs by selling them.\n\nYou can make money with NFTs if you buy smartly and sell later. For example, buyers can bid on Amitabh Bachchan's NFT collection when it goes up for auction in November. They might be worth more in the future. You can make money with NFTs if you buy and sell them at the right times. You can also make your own digital art, video or audio clips, and music as NFTs and sell them if you are a musician or a beginning painter.\n\nIf you are planning to invest, NFTs are the current big thing.

These four fields focus on new ideas, problem-solving and thinking critically. All of them together make up a popular and quickly growing business.\n\nMost people in STEM fields do their jobs every day with the help of computers and other tech. Many people also use the scientific method to test theories and hypotheses. As technology gets better, STEM education for girls is becoming more important. Even so, many people still think that STEM is not for girls, even though it is essential.\n\nPeople used to think boys were better at math, science, and other related subjects. So, boys are more likely to go into these fields. This idea has hurt girls' confidence in their STEM skills. By helping girls in STEM, we can help them feel good about themselves and their skills again. Self-confidence and knowing yourself are the first steps to doing well in school. Making STEM education more welcoming for girls will help them feel better about themselves and open up great new opportunities for them in the future.\n\nGirls will be more comfortable with computers and technology once they feel like they belong in STEM fields. We use technology in almost every part of our lives as a society. Most people use technology in some way every single day.\n\nMany women and girls don't think of themselves as tech-savvy right now. This is starting to change as more and more girls learn to code and programme. Since computers and technology will only become more important in the coming years, it's essential that everyone, especially girls, feels comfortable and confident using them.\n\nAlso, good problem-solving skills can help young girls get closer to their goals in an always-changing and unpredictable world. STEM education is the best way to teach kids how to solve problems.\n\nCritical thinking is needed to set up an experiment, make a prediction, test that prediction, and then look at the results. Why did one test work and the other one not? What can we do differently to make things better? These questions force students to think about how to solve a problem in a new way. The best part is that you can use this way of thinking outside of STEM and in almost any situation in life. Teaching young girls to feel this way through STEM education improves their ability to solve problems and sets them up for future success. But here's the thing, sometimes, girls may not be exposed to STEM early in life. That should not deter you. Technology is constantly evolving, and so is the job market. A STEM career is highly beneficial, both to you and to society. There are various career options, a lot of exposure and a high salary.

You can also take[ Career Guidance ](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance)at Glow & Lovely Careers(formerly Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).\n\n## What is transcribing?\n\nWhen you transcribe, you listen to recorded audio (or video) and type exactly what you hear. There are many different kinds of audio files, such as market research focus groups, interviews, meetings, phone calls, zoom calls, etc.\n\nThere are different types of transcription jobs, including general, market research, legal and medical transcription. General transcription usually needs no experience. Some companies instead ask transcribers to take a test to make sure they meet their standards.\n\nFor specialised areas of transcription like medical transcription or legal transcription, either training or experience is needed. But medical and legal transcriptionists make more money than other types of transcriptionists.\n\n## What kinds of skills do they need?\n\nA good transcriber needs several skills, such as:\n\n- Clients pay for the service, so pay close attention to the details. It needs to be typed up without any mistakes and according to the style rules of the transcription company.\n- At least 70 words per minute typing speed – various online free typing speed tests can check how fast you can type.\n- Writing skills: excellent English language and grammar.\n- Discretion – you might be transcribing confidential audio. Hence, such audio cannot be talked about.\n- Computer savvy – you will need to be good at typing. Word processing software skills will be a bonus.\n- Listening skills – Transcribers need to be able to listen to audio recordings carefully and figure out what they mean.\n- Time management – deadlines are non-negotiable.\n\nSo, is it a good career option? Let's weigh the pros and cons:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Work hours that are flexible and work with your life\n- Chance to work from home – who wouldn't like that?\n- Fun: Many people find transcription work fun, giving them a real sense of accomplishment.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Audio that is hard to understand – This may be because the audio is poor quality, contains heavy accents, or people are talking simultaneously.\n- Unfamiliar terms – If there is a word/term you don't understand, you may have to spend extra time researching the correct spelling. The transcription process will be longer in these situations. This could be stressful.\n- Sometimes, there may be lull periods – as a freelancer, occasionally, there may not be any work available for a short period.\n- Each transcription company has a style guide that must be followed, so the transcription process might initially be slow. It can take a while to fully understand and feel confident using it, but practice makes perfect.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is this job for you? Remember, payments usually vary. The more experience you have and the faster you can deliver, the higher your pay.

The country has an impressive record of female workforce participation and representation in leadership positions, with several companies offering menstrual leave as part of their HR policies. But while workplace policies are evolving globally, they remain restrictive in some parts of India.\n\nHave you ever wondered how long I need to take off work during my period? What should I do if I get sick during my period? Or when can I take time off from work because of these things? Here's all you need to know about taking leave during menstruation!\n\nIn India, the menstrual leave policy is not common. In fact, women in India are still not comfortable talking about their periods. The stigma and shame surrounding menstruation make it challenging to ask for leave or compensation after they're back at work.\n\nThe menstrual leave policy is a policy that allows women to take time off from work during menstruation. This is an important issue for many women, as they feel discomfort during their periods and wish to be away from work.\n\nBut there are many cultural stigmas and other taboos which have thwarted the introduction of such policies in India (and elsewhere). Some companies feel that offering menstrual leave will create competition between them and their competitors; others simply don't want their staff members discussing private matters at work.\n\nSo-called \"period leave\" has existed in some parts of China and Japan for years. Italian legislators are reportedly considering offering it there as well.\n\nThough most companies in India don't offer menstrual leave to women, some have taken a step forward to update their policies for working women.\n\nThe Menstruation Benefits Bill 2017′ states that all women are privileged to get monthly Menstrual Leave in India of two days. The bill is made for women working in public and private organizations. These firms are registered with either the Central government or the state governments.\n\nZomato was one of the first Indian companies to introduce menstrual leave. The company started offering 12 days off every month for women who are experiencing their periods or are pregnant and nursing mothers. Other companies, such as Watsup Brothers, have also introduced similar policies for working women. Byju's, Culture Magazine, iVIPANAN, Swiggy, Mathrubhumi, Magzter, IndustryARC, FlyMyBiz and Gozoop allow menstrual leave.\n\nHopefully, those companies that have already introduced menstrual leave policies will soon be joined by more. It's time for the Indian government to catch up and ensure women aren't left out of their jobs due to their periods.

Psychology deals with people's thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Psychologists try to understand how people think and feel. They do this by looking at their behaviour in different situations and contexts. Psychologists usually need at least a master's degree to practice.\n\n## Psychology includes several subfields. Some of them are:\n\n### Clinical psychologists:\n\nClinical psychologists evaluate, diagnose and treat people with mental illnesses like anxiety and depression. These can be challenging to identify, so clinical psychologists need to understand the symptoms of these diseases. They also help patients deal with other issues, such as addiction or eating disorders.\n\n### Educational psychologists:\n\nEducational psychologists specialize in helping children and teenagers succeed in the education system. They can help students with learning problems, behavioural problems, social and emotional difficulties, mental health issues and physical disabilities.\n\n### Criminal psychologists:\n\nA criminal psychologist works with police officers to identify a criminal's motives, personality and potential for violence. Criminologists study the causes of crime and how to prevent it.\n\n### Humanistic psychologists:\n\nHumanistic psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on the inherent goodness of people and the importance of being true to oneself.\n\n### Behavioural psychologists:\n\nBehavioural psychology is the study of how behaviour is influenced by environmental factors and how it can be changed through different interventions. It looks at the causes behind behaviours and ways to change them.\n\n### Sports psychologists:\n\nSports psychologists help athletes improve their performance through innate strength training, stress management and goal setting. The psychologist would also work with them on finding ways of managing their emotions during competition so that they don't get overwhelmed by feelings of fear or anxiety.\n\n### Biological psychologists:\n\nBiological psychology focuses on behaviour patterns that emerge from the interactions between the structure and function of the nervous system.\n\n### Counselling psychologists:\n\nCounselling psychologists work alongside psychiatrists, social workers and other specialists to address mental health and well-being problems.\n\nThey can help people with depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, substance abuse or any other type of problem that affects their ability to function.\n\n### Organizational psychologists:\n\nOrganizational psychologists help businesses create supportive environments where people can do their best work. They develop well-being programs, good management practices and talent assessment tools.\n\n### Experimental psychologists:\n\nExperimental psychologists focus on human behaviour through controlled experiments and research methods like observation, surveys and case studies. They use the results of these experiments to discover general principles about behaviour across a range of situations.

Etiquette is the basic set of rules of behaviour in any environment. There are various types of etiquette - Workplace etiquette, Dinner-table etiquette, Social etiquette, and more.\n\nHaving good etiquette helps make everyone around you comfortable. It is polite and considered good manners to have good etiquette. This is because it shows that you respect and value the other party.\n\nThe most essential type of etiquette is social etiquette. This extends beyond just 'please' and 'thank you'. Social etiquette is used in almost every situation.\n\nIt is pretty common to be anxious when meeting someone new or noteworthy. Social etiquette helps you make a good impression and confidently manage any social situation. Having good social etiquette can help you create trust and build long-lasting relationships.\n\n## We all know a few of the basic etiquette rules. They are:\n\n1. Greeting people when you meet them and remembering their names.\n2. Apologising or thanking people depending on the situation.\n3. Politely making your way through a crowd using 'excuse me'.\n4. Apologising or Excusing yourself after sneezing.\n5. Holding the door for somebody behind you.\n\n### Here are some more things that are not commonly known, to follow:\n\n1. When you meet someone face-to-face,\n\n- Greet the other person and introduce yourself with your full name. A firm handshake with a smile goes a long way.\n- Saying 'Nice to meet you' is a good ice-breaker.\n- Make eye contact, keep a good posture, and look confident, but don't be rude or unprofessional. This helps give you a good impression.\n- Don't interrupt someone mid-sentence. Always listen attentively.\n- Pay attention to the other person's body language and act appropriately.\n\n1. When you meet someone virtually,\n\n- Dress for the occasion. You may have to turn on your camera, and it is best to be prepared for any situation. You don't want to look sloppy in front of the other person.\n- Mute your microphone when you are not speaking to avoid disturbance or background feedback.\n- Try to avoid checking your phone or doing something else. You might think you are being discreet. But sometimes, it is pretty evident that you aren't paying attention.\n\n1. When you use social media and/on communicate online,\n\n- If you have sent a friend or follow request that hasn't been accepted, it is best to leave it be. Do not send repeat requests.\n- Try to only send requests to people you know or who know you in some way. If you wish to connect with somebody else, it is appropriate to message them and state your purpose.

Along with being proud of this great achievement, what we must also bring to notice is the fact that this achievement could have been much bigger if the women in India joined the workforce in much larger numbers than they have.\n\nResearch suggests that increasing women’s labor force participation by 10 percentage points could add $700 billion to India’s GDP by 2025 (or a 1.4% increase). This shows the significance of having more women in the workforce to help the economy grow. Although we have 43% of the total working women in regular wage and salaried positions by the year 2011-2012 (which is an increase from the 28.5% that existed in 1993-1994), we have still a long way to go in terms of including more and more women into the workforce of India.\n\n![Working women](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/125.png) *[1500x860]*As an initiative towards encouraging women from even the most remote parts of the country to come forward and start earning their own livelihood, the Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) has launched the Pehli Tankha or First Salary campaign, that includes spreading awareness about the benefits that the woman and their families can get from allowing girls to go out and work.

However, this will take 1-3 years longer, depending on your graduation course duration.\n\nAfter this, you can opt for a Master of Law (LLM) degree to hone your skill. LLM is optional and not a requirement.\n\n### To gain admission into a law college, you will have to give any of the law entrance exams. 4 popular law entrance exams are:\n\n- All India Law Entrance Test (AILET)\n- Symbiosis Law Admission Test (SLAT)\n- Law School Admission Test (LSAT)\n- Maharashtra Common Entrance Test - Law (MC-CET)\n\nYou will gain admission based on your scores on the test. Additionally, you can choose to intern at court or volunteer for extra points.\n\nThe LLM course focuses on all aspects of society and law. You will study all subjects to help you better understand the law and the society around you. These include economics, political science, sociology, etc. You will also learn law-related subjects like criminal law, constitutional law and family law.\n\nYou are a lawyer once you have successfully cleared your finals in LLB. But to become an advocate with permission to practise law, you will need to pass the All India Bar Examination( AIBE). The exam is conducted annually by the Bar Council of India. You must first register as a lawyer in a state bar council to be eligible for the exam.\n\nOnce you pass the exam, start applying for jobs and gain experience. You can start with internships at law firms or any legal job at law offices. You can also practise independently. However, it is recommended that you first gain experience before going off on your own. In India, law firms offer a salary in the range of Rs 25-30 lakh per annum to Rs 150-200 lakh for experienced advocates. Even just graduated advocates get between Rs 5-10 lakh per year to Rs 18-20 lakh per year. It takes a lot of hard work to become a lawyer. So, if you think you want to become one, start by studying for the law school entrance exams. You can upskill with [free courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=law-and-order) by Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) to help you prepare.

Her journey to get there wasn’t an easy one. But with the support of her mother, a few colleagues and a Glow & Lovely Careers Scholarship, she fulfilled all her dreams. Here’s her success story:\n\nAs Niharika would say, her entire life has been a journey filled with obstacles. She was born into a financially struggling family with an alcoholic, abusive father. By the 5th grade, Niharika was forced to join a Telugu-medium school as her mother could no longer afford the fees. Luckily for her, the government had passed a law stating that classes from 6th grade onward would be taught in English. She mentioned that joining a Government School was a huge turning point in her life. She was provided with many opportunities to learn and grow. Niharika excelled in school - She participated in various competitions, was a state-level hockey player and was awarded the best cadet in the NCC. In 9th grade, her father succumbed to a heart attack. Instead of getting her married or forcing her to leave her studies and work, her mother became the driving force in her life.\n\nHer brilliant marks (9.7/10 CGPA) and all-rounder skills paved the way for her to join the Electronics and Communications Engineering at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Basar, Telangana, under government scholarship. She submitted two projects to NASA in her first year, receiving honourary mentions. But her scholarship fell through, and she was threatened with expulsion if she couldn’t come up with the fees (INR50K). When nothing else seemed to work, she came across the Buddy4Study Scholarship network, a Glow & Lovely Careers partner. After listening to her story and achievements, Glow & Lovely Careers knew she deserved to let her light shine. Such talent needed to be given a chance to grow. She was awarded the Glow & Lovely Scholarship, which helped her pay her fees and continue her education.\n\nAs a kid, Niharika was inspired by the ‘Road Not Taken’, So even when nothing seemed to go her way, she persevered to make her dreams come true. It did not matter to her what others would think - which is why she chose a career completely different from her stream - arithmetic and logical reasoning trainer, she helped many undergrad students become placement ready. In addition, Niharika always wanted to give back to society and decided to help make India a better place for girls like her. Hence, she joined the innovation fellowship of Telangana State Innovation Cell, which works toward creating a culture of innovation in the state from all backgrounds. Niharika considers TSIC as her second family; they helped her apply to the University of Massachusetts to pursue her master’s after her mother’s demise. She is deeply grateful to Dr Shanta Thoutam, the Chief Innovation Officer of TSIC, for her support.. Niharika has won the student elections and was recently announced as a Graduate Student Senate officer (Treasurer) and also works as her department’s communications manager.\n\nHer mother, unfortunately, passed away during the second covid wave but her memories and advice remain. Niharika wishes to pass on her favourite saying from her mother to all aspiring girls out there: “Dream Big and Never Give up” When asked if there was anything that inspired her, Niharika excitedly shared her screen to show her favourite quote, “Dreams don’t work unless you do!” She wishes that girls nowadays work towards their dreams and not compromise on them. When you work towards something, the universe will find a way to give you the help you require when you need it the most.

Today, many women are seen challenging the norms and breaking the barriers by taking on roles that were once reserved for men.\n\nGender biases and stereotypes are still prevalent across all sectors. Women are still discouraged from taking up some jobs and choosing a particular career path because it is considered a 'man's job'. However, the young women of India are now questioning the status quo and confidently taking up traditional male-dominated jobs.\n\nAccording to a study by The Times of India, 12-15% of male-dominated jobs are estimated to have been replaced by women! They include bartenders, barbers, chefs, delivery associates, and train/bus drivers, to name a few.\n\nWhile women have been shining in these roles and other services, they are even taking up the role of a **petrol pump attendant.**\n\nIn 2005, India's first all-**woman petrol pump** was set up in New Delhi. The entire fuel station was managed and operated by women. From filling petrol to checking tyre pressure, it was all taken care of by women. A few years back, women running a petrol pump was hardly imaginable. But today, one can see them working in several fuel stations across the country. In 2021, the Indian Oil Company Limited (IOCL) announced 83 retail outlets across the country operated by women!\n\nEven in the remote parts of India, more and more fuel stations are hiring a woman as a **petrol pump attendant**. This has caused a snowball effect, encouraging more women to accept jobs at petrol pump stations as **pump attendants**. This has led to their financial independence and a boost to their confidence.\n\nThe Government of Maharashtra has even launched an innovative training course titled 'Gas Station, Petrol Pump Sevak' for women. Under this program, women will be given training for 7 days with 90 days of on-the-job training. The trained women will be directly employed at state-run petroleum companies' gas stations and petrol pumps.\n\nThis program provides employment opportunities and skill development for women from low-income groups, especially in areas where women are not represented.\n\n## What is the role of women workers at petrol pumps:\n\nAs a **petrol pump attendant,** you are expected to serve petrol to customers at the filling station. You may also have to check the oil and water of the car and clean the windscreen. You may be required to inspect and fix minor things on motorcars and motorcycles. When customers pay for their petrol/diesel or other purchases, you need to collect payments, return the change or prepare charge slips, if necessary. Undertaking stock control and preparing reports on fuel oil, accessories and other items sold would also be a part of your job profile.\n\n### Training needed to be women workers at petrol pumps:\n\nYou would get the required training on the job itself. At first, you will be assigned simple tasks such as cleaning the station, serving petrol, and wiping the windscreens. Once you gain some experience, you will be given more advanced work, such as doing simple maintenance tasks on vehicles, fitting car parts and helping keep records.\n\nWorking up the ranks may help you advance to various jobs, including cashiers and senior attendant managers.\n\n[Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) offers you tips, [online tests](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-tests), [courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) and [guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options) to help you for our future growth.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** petrol pump attendant, woman petrol pump, women workers at petrol pumps, pump attendant, Exciting Jobs\n\n",

We are gradually breaking down barriers that have limited the participation of women in these fields. Let’s shed some light on the inspiring journeys of young women interested in **engineering for women** in India.\n\nThe underrepresentation of **women in STEM** has been a global concern. Historically, societal norms and stereotypes have discouraged women from pursuing careers in **science and technology**. However, in recent years, the narrative is changing rapidly.\n\nOne of the primary avenues enabling this change is the availability of **STEM courses** designed to nurture the talents of young women. These courses provide the necessary skills, knowledge, and hands-on experience essential for success in STEM fields. Many institutions across India offer these specialized courses for women to explore their passion for science and technology without hesitation.\n\nAs a result of these initiatives, the number of **women in science and technology** is on the rise. This transformation also extends to engineering, where **female engineers** feel their presence in various sectors, from computer science to civil engineering.\n\nThe success stories of Indian women in STEM are a testament to their determination and passion. One such inspiring woman is Dr. Kalpana Chawla, an Indian-American astronaut who became the first woman of Indian origin in space. Dr. Chawla's journey from Karnal, India, to becoming a NASA astronaut is a shining example of what young women in India can achieve with dedication and education. \n\n\n\n![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/Women%20in%20STEM.jpg) *[784x490]*\n\nThe story of Sudha Murthy, a renowned engineer and the Chairperson of Infosys Foundation, is another example of the potential women hold in STEM. She was one of the first female engineers to join TATA Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. Her journey from a small town to a significant role in India's IT sector has paved the way for many young women. \n\n\n\n![Online Courses](https://st4stgglowandlovely4p4ci.blob.core.windows.net/prd-glowandlovelycareers/contents/india/blog/inline-images/Women%20in%20STEM%202.jpg) *[799x600]*\n\nWhile the progress is encouraging, achieving gender balance in STEM remains challenging. The gender gap still exists, and many young women face obstacles and biases in their educational and professional journeys. Initiatives to promote **engineering for women** are essential in this journey. Encouraging STEM education from an early age, fostering an inclusive environment, and providing mentorship opportunities can go a long way in breaking down existing barriers.\n\nThe increasing availability of **STEM courses**, the growing representation of **women in science and technology**, and the inspiring stories of **female engineers** all point to a promising future for young women interested in STEM. The journey towards gender equality in STEM fields is ongoing, and there is still work to be done, but the progress made so far is good.\n\nFor those seeking inspiration on the path to success in the field of STEM, explore the wide range of [courses](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses) offered across different fields on [Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/).

From the advent of online platforms to the rise of citizen journalism, the journey from bloggers to correspondents signifies a paradigm shift in how information is disseminated and consumed in India.\n\nThe traditional image of a journalist, usually male-dominated, is being challenged by a new generation of young women who are passive observers and active contributors to the field. Many of these individuals come from diverse educational backgrounds, with a growing number holding degrees in **journalism and mass communication**. This educational foundation equips them with the necessary skills to navigate the complex world of news reporting.\n\nOne significant trend that has emerged is the rise of young women embracing the role of a **freelance journalist**. This shift is fueled by the flexibility and accessibility that online platforms provide. With the digital age in full swing, these women are leveraging the power of the internet to tell compelling stories, breaking away from the conventional confines of mainstream media.\n\nThe advent of **online journalism** platforms has democratised the field, allowing young women to establish their voices and reach a wider audience. The ability to publish content online has broken down barriers, enabling these women to transcend geographical limitations and connect with readers nationwide. Blogs, once considered personal diaries, are now powerful tools for disseminating information and shaping public opinion.\n\nTake the case of Nisha Patel, a young blogger turned correspondent, who has been at the forefront of this transformation. Armed with a degree in **journalism and mass communication**, Nisha started her journey as a blogger, using her online platform to discuss social issues often overlooked by mainstream media. Her insightful and well-researched content caught the attention of online journalism portals, paving the way for her to become a freelance correspondent.\n\nThe evolution from bloggers to correspondents highlights the changing dynamics of storytelling. These young women are not just reporting news but shaping narratives and influencing public discourse. The diversity of voices brought forth by this new wave of journalists enriches the Indian media landscape, providing a more comprehensive and inclusive representation of society.\n\nThe empowerment of young women in **Indian journalism** is also reflected in their ability to tackle taboo subjects. Issues such as gender inequality, mental health, and environmental concerns are given a spotlight through their work. Addressing these topics contributes to a more informed and socially aware audience.\n\nThe transformation of young women from bloggers to correspondents is a testament to the power of inclusivity and the impact of technology on the media landscape. As these individuals continue to break barriers, it is clear that the future of **journalism and mass communication** in India will be shaped by their unique perspectives and dedication to uncovering stories that matter.\n\nYoung women's journey, from bloggers to correspondents, signifies a significant shift in **Indian journalism**. The rise of freelance journalists and the prominence of **online journalism** platforms showcase a departure from traditional structures. As these individuals continue to redefine the narrative, the inclusivity and diversity they bring will undoubtedly shape the future of media in India, making it more dynamic and reflective of the society it serves.\n\nAt [Glow & Lovely Careers](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/) (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation), we are committed to empowering women towards independence.
