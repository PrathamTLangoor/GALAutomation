They are responsible for creating and increasing the on-ground market for a company’s products. They do this by carefully promoting the products and selling them to a large pool of distributors and shopkeepers.\n\nNaturally, one cannot do that unless they have a very in-depth understanding of what the company or product brand is all about. They must also have a good understanding of who the products are for. This will help them convince distributors and sellers about why the products that they are selling will do well. A career as a marketing executive may be perfect for you if you love talking to people. Good communication skills are important in almost any job, but especially in a position that requires you to be in the field, interacting with people.\n\nIt might seem like you may need a lot of qualifications to get a job as a marketing executive. But worry not, if you are keen on joining the industry, it is quite simple to get started. You should be at least 18 years of age and have completed your school education, which means that you should have passed class 12. It is also a good option to pursue this career if you are currently in college and looking for job opportunities.\n\nYou may be curious about what a typical marketing executive’s job demands. So let us begin by sharing a few important details. Firstly, the timings for work might vary from company to company, but they are mostly day shifts. So you need not worry about working late evenings. Secondly, it is a field job, so you would be required to travel. Make sure your personal situation allows you to travel regularly, as it is a key part of this job. Having a personal two-wheeler would be quite helpful as you will not be dependent on public transport services for your travel which will cover a lot of areas in a city.\n\nTypical marketing executive jobs in India can pay between Rs. 1,49,000 to Rs. 5,48,000 per year[1](https://www.payscale.com/research/IN/Job=Marketing_Executive/Salary). This number can vary, depending on your years of experience, performance levels, and your company’s incentives. For example, some companies may have annual bonuses, some have sales commissions, and some may offer profit sharing. So when you apply for the job, make sure you ask about these details and are clear about how much you stand to make for your work and effort.\n\nA career as a marketing executive is exciting but also quite challenging. The travel involved and the need to meet monthly targets means you have to always be highly focused. You may not meet the targets on some occasions, but you have to keep yourself motivated. If you are ambitious and love meeting challenges, you will have a successful career in this role. On the plus side, you will be able to create a vast network that can help you as you progress further in your career. The qualifications required for such a job are fairly basic, which means you start quite young.\n\nIf you are looking for tips for building your marketing career or want to hone your interview skills to apply for a job as a marketing executive, you can register with Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).

Does your college rely on you to come up with the most exciting science project? Then, you’ll find the story of these two young entrepreneurs truly inspiring.\n\nNupura Kirloskar and Janhanvi Joshi were recently featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. Their humanitarian company, BleeTech, has been praised globally. It all started when the duo went to see a dance performance by a group of deaf students. They observed that there was a lack of coordination within the dancers, and the audience wasn’t fully engaged. Nupura and Janhavi were in the 3rd year of college pursuing product designing. They felt that it was an interesting problem to solve. And started working on it as a simple project assignment. The idea was so ingenious that their college professors insisted that they take it up as the main assignment in the final year too.\n\nThe product was tested on the same dancers. Jahanvi confesses that they were scared, but the dancer’s reaction changed everything for them. What started as an idea for project assignment soon became the bedrock for their founding company, BleeTech Innovations.\n\nTalking about the challenges the two young women have had to overcome, Nupura says that they did not have any knowledge of managing a business. They have learnt it all on the job. She admits that they were nervous after their first hire. Being accountable for someone’s salary sent shivers down their spine. But, over time, the team has grown from strength to strength. They have learnt the art of delegating work, managing teams and developing a strategy for the future growth of their company.\n\nNupura and Jahanvi went to the same college and graduated together. They were roommates. So, becoming the co-founders of a company seems like a natural progression to them. They believe that the secret to their success is their collaborative efforts and the fact that they complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\nBleeTech Innovations has come up with many products that have drastically improved the quality of life for its users. Take, for example, their first product, a smartwatch. It is a revolutionary watch which listens for you. The watch has an in-built sound detection mechanism. It stores the sound, and when it is played again, the clock guides its user accordingly.\n\nAnother example of their innovative thinking is AskBlee which serves as a search engine for the deaf. The users can get their answers in sign language. The platform has over 500 active subscribers. Together, the young innovators have designed around 30 products.\n\nThe future belongs to problem solvers. But, before you can start innovating, you need to be thorough with your basics. Free online physics courses can help you advance your knowledge and understanding of various concepts in physics. Register on the Glow and Lovely Careers (formerly called, Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) website. Through our affiliation with various educational portals like edX and NIIT, you can gain access to a host of free physics courses online in the[ Science and Research field](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/searchResult?searchKey=physics)**.** These courses are categorized as beginner, intermediate and expert levels. Women already working in the product research department will find courses like [Physical Application of Stochastic Processes](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/course-detail/niit-144/physics-physical-applications-of-stochastic-processes)** **particularly useful.\n\nWhen you’ve acquired the necessary knowledge, you can apply it creatively to design different types of products. Who says science and women don’t mix? The field is full of shining examples like Nupura and Janhavi, and we could do with many more young women shaping the science and technology sector.\n\n## Quick Tips/Tricks:\n\n1.

Many even discourage girls from taking up technology, science, and even mathematics. Prerna is a classic example of how women can be good at any career they choose. In fact, with hard work, the right [career choice, and guidance](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance), a girl can achieve whatever she wants.\n\n## Prerna Kalra’s story is one such example….\n\n### A successful career in finance and technology\n\nPrerna started her career in the field of finance and technology. She joined Paytm, where she was among the first five employees of the company. There she went on to become the former Head of Products, Paytm-Wallet, and filed a patent within Paytm.\n\n### A visit abroad and a business idea is born.\n\nIt was Prerna’s visit to China that gave her inspiration for starting Daalchini. In China, Prerna saw vending machines with all types of fresh food – from fruits to momos. All one had to do was put some money in the vending machine, and they would get fresh food!\n\nPrerna realized that these types of vending machines were not present in India. And her business idea, Daalchini Technologies, was born!\n\n**Daalchini Technologies provides affordable, healthy snacks and home-style meals through vending machines and smart shops.**\n\nThrough Daalchini, one can get frozen/chilled meals, meal kits, snacks, bakery items, immunity boosters, healthy/energy drinks, yogurt, and more. It has also partnered with cloud kitchens and home chefs for fresh meals.\n\n### Combining technology, business, food…and hard work\n\nWhile preparing fresh food is easy. Keeping it fresh for the whole day is challenging. This is where Prerna and her co-founder, Vidyabhushan, got in their technical expertise. Prerna’s previous work experience in finance and technology also proved to be helpful.\n\nA typical day for those working at Daalchini starts at 3 am. Yes, 3 am! While the rest of the world is still asleep, the people in Daalchini are busy. They prepare fresh food daily. The recipes and ingredients are already ready. Finally when the food is cooked, it is chilled, packed and prepared for distribution.\n\nYes, it is hard work. But hard work is one of the reasons why Daalchini has been a success story in such a short time.\n\n**Daalchini started around 2017- 2018 with just two vending machines. And today, it has**\n\n- **400 machines across India**\n- **Daalchini products are sold in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Goa, Chandigarh, Mohali, and many other parts of India**\n\n**And…..**\n\nBy the end of March 2022, Daalchini is expecting an annual turnover of 144 crores.\n\n**Winning awards, accepting challenges, and succeeding**\n\nIt was not easy for Prerna to leave her job at Paytm. But she decided to take the risk. And her gamble paid off. Today, Daalchini vending machines and products are available in many parts of India, and the company is expanding even more.\n\nPrerna herself has received many awards, acknowledging her contribution, such as\n\n- TimessheUnltd Women Entrepreneur Award 2019\n- Retail Startup of the Year 2021 Award by Entrepreneur India\n- The startup was selected for Atal Innovation Mission by NITI Aayog in August 2019\n- Top 100 startups in India by SutraHR in Jan 2020\n\nDuring the Pandemic, people were not stepping out much. But rather than considering this as a challenge, Prerna and her team saw this as an opportunity. They added more food options and modified their way of working to suit the pandemic needs. Better hygiene, more home-cooked meals, better delivery were some of the things that Prerna and her team focused on. They also started vending machines in hospitals – to provide fresh meal options where they were most required.\n\nPrerna saw opportunities where people saw challenges. And that is one of the main reasons why Daalchini and Prerna are both success stories today. Prerna’s story inspires all that girls can achieve – once they set their hearts to it.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Career Guidance, Inspirational Women in India, Online Career Guidance, women success stories, Free career guidance\n\n",

When they buy cosmetics from me and use it and come back with a good feedback, it gives me immense amount of job satisfaction. In addition to this, the job a beauty consultant benefits me on a personal level as well.

And, before the customers begin to flow in I check the available stock of products and compare it with the list that was made the previous day. Once the customers start coming in, I start showing them the cosmetics and makeup products and I also do makeup for those who ask for it.\n\n### Q3. How do you decide what product to suggest to a customer?\n\nAns: At our company, we have been given ample training about what product to suggest to what customer, in terms of their skin type and face structure as well. We have been trained adequately to be able to assess the skin type and complexion of a person and give cosmetics and makeup products that would help enhance her beauty and not harm her skin.

In addition to recommending suitable products to the customers, I also give them makeup tips. I always stay ready to answer their queries, and this makes the customer want to come back and shop with me again. I always ask them for feedback so that I am able to improve my work and body language. In case the customer does not like a certain product, then I try to understand from her what the issue was and suggest a better product. I have received appreciation and rewards from my company for the hard work I have done.\n\n### Q5. What do you feel are the basic skills a beauty advisor should have?\n\nAns: A beauty advisor should ideally have good product knowledge and sales skills. She should keep updating herself with the latest cosmetic and makeup products that arrive in the market. She should also develop qualities like patience, curiosity to learn more and the ability to explain things in a lucid manner to the customers. She should come across to her customers in a pleasing way so that she wins their trust and have them come back to your store again.\n\n### Q6.

It is very important to provide a good customer service to ensure customers are satisfied and they come back again. When customers are happy, they spread the word in a positive way, making a brand or service popular. This leads to business growth as more people get to know about it.\n\nCustomer care executives are the face of a company. Their job is to address every customer’s problem with patience, ensuring maximum satisfaction. Besides their core responsibilities, they go that extra mile just to make their customers’ day and provide them with best possible solutions. Clients can be annoying, impatient, hilarious and at times good too. But a customer care representative knows how to deal smartly with different people, turning them into happy customers. The job isn’t easy but it is very rewarding.\n\nIf you want to become one, bring smiles on the faces and increase a brand’s value with your excellent service, there are multiple **online courses** designed to enhance the skills you need to become a successful customer care representative. You can look for **online courses after graduation** or short courses that you can take up along with your studies.\n\nIf you are thinking how a customer care representative works through the day, here is how her daily schedule looks:\n\nThe day typically begins quite early (between 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) with checking the emails that have come overnight and responding to all the queries. There will usually be some inquiries that will need follow up from other departments like in case of a product-return, payment issue or any service-related. During the day there is likely to be at least one team meeting with the unit lead as customer care representatives usually work in teams with a clear reporting structure so that serious cases can be handled by seniors.\n\nUsually, a customer care representative is expected to answer emails as well as calls during a day. Another responsibility is to handle customer calls to resolve their complaints. During weekdays, the call flow is less as compared to the weekends. In some cases, the representative also needs to call customers back to update or provide them with the information they have been looking for. For example, on refund status or respond to feedback submitted by them.\n\nAnother thing that a customer care representative needs to do on a daily basis is to keep track of complaints that require more time to get resolved and of the cases that have already been resolved. This practice keeps the work organized and is necessary for reporting on the performance of the unit that the representative is a member of.\n\nWhile all this is a part of the job, it is also important to always keep yourself motivated and in a good mood if you want to be successful as a customer service executive. If you are positive and filled with energy, you can easily achieve your goal of customer satisfaction.\n\nHere are some handy tips if you are looking to make a career in the field of customer care or customer relationship management:\n\n- Keep calm and be patient\n- Be an active listener\n- Develop strong communication skills\n- Improve your ability to multi-task\n- Get familiar with CRM tools and softwares\n- Never give up on any situation or customer\n\nWhile some people think the job of a customer service representative is to simply answer the calls, provide the same set of responses and work like a robot, it definitely goes well beyond that. The job can be quite challenging but involves a lot of creativity and fun while talking to a customer. When managing calls, you might come across different kinds of people and you will experience a lot of personal and professional growth. You will also get many opportunities to lead teams as people with 1-2 years experience in customer care are usually valued highly and required to guide others.\n\nFor women, the advantage of specializing in customer care is that there are now companies that allow you to answer and make calls from home. This arrangement provides a lot of flexibility.\n\nGlow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation) provides you with free **professional courses online** related to various industries. It also offers **career guidance** through a list of career options and **career tests online** that will help you in your **career development**.

Data segmentation is a process whereby you divide the big chunk of data on the basis of the information you are looking for. Segments let you isolate and analyze subsets of data so that you can examine the trends in your business. For instance, of a certain number of customers, if you want to segregate a group of them who are from Bangalore who purchased products from one specific category, then data segmentation is what you will have to do.\n\n3.Now that Susmitha has performed the data segmentation part, the next step is to do ‘Data Wrangling’.

It offers several well-paid opportunities in different roles like HR generalist, HR manager, HR consultant, training and development manager, executive recruiter and many others. Over the last few years, the role of HR professionals has evolved. They are now powerful people in an organization who understand the value of employees and have an important role in making business decisions. They are also responsible for building an organizational culture. From handling recruitments, payroll and employee retention to ensuring a healthy work environment for all the employees, a HR professional handles a wide range of responsibilities essential to long-term business success.\n\nIf you want to make your career in HR, the first step is to get a bachelor’s degree, however, some employers prefer master’s degree in human resources or an MBA. You can also take up **online certification** course to add value to your resume. Post this, you would need on-the-job experience where you can apply whatever you have learned. If you are looking to work at a managerial level, the right work experience will help you get there.\n\nWhy is HR one of the best career options, esepcially for women?\n\nThere are several reasons why women seek to make a career in the field of human resources.\n\n- You get a chance to work and deal with people at different levels - great for people who are social and outgoing\n- You have the power to recruit the right people and develop them - offers good opportunitities to use and hone your talent-spotting abilities\n- Every day is a different day with a variety of work and new challenges - HR folks rarely complain about their jobs being 'boring' or monotonous\n- You get an opportunity to change lives as you guide employees in making career-related decisions - The job offers a lot of emotional fulfillment\n- You are paid really well - Goes without saying, money matters!\n\nThe job of a HR professional is quite diverse and is not limited to just hiring people for an organization and handling payroll. It is much more than that. To give you an idea, here is the typical daily schedule of a human resource manager in a growing organization.\n\nIf you are working at a managerial level in the HR department, you have to work closely with the heads of all the three departments- Recruitment, Operations, & Administration.\n\n- The day typically starts with checking emails for any requirements. Next task is to sit with the team to discuss the day’s schedule. Once you have the agenda for the day, it becomes easy to prioritize all the tasks and get the work delivered within the timelines.\n- Then comes taking follow-ups on the current openings in the organization. If there are any interviews already lined up, you need to check they are happening as per the schedule so that the positions get closed on time. Interviews normally happen in the morning and depending on the role and number of candidates, the process can stretch till evening. In case of new candidates joining, the on-boarding activities occupy most of the time in the morning.\n- Post lunch is when other non-recruitment tasks are taken up. If there are any review or appraisal meetings planned, your responsibility as a manager is to see they are happening and ask for updates from the head of departments. After the reviews and ratings are given to the employees, next step is to coordinate with the HR head who will discuss with each employee, on the ratings given.\n- Another thing which is part of your daily schedule is to keep a check on HR administration activities as they contribute in a smooth functioning of an organization. These activities are taken care of by dedicated admin staff and include both general and HR-related tasks like:\n\n1. Filing employee documents\n2. Distributing information to employees\n3. Helping in scheduling meetings and arranging meeting rooms\n4. Making travel arrangements\n5. Processing expense reports\n6. Ensuring the repair work is done\n7. Maintaining food quality\n\n- During the day, your team might get additional requests from other departments such as providing data on the number of employees in a particular project or department. Here you need to ensure your team is catering to such requests on time.\n- Lastly, at the end of the day, you need to see what will be the next day’s tasks so that you plan your day accordingly. These tasks include- employee training, engagement activities, exit interviews, etc.\n\nThe role is not tough but very rewarding. As you grow and reach a higher level, you can be a business partner to the organization and help management take the required decisions for the company’s growth and development.\n\nReady to explore this career opportunity?

You can gain a basic understanding of makeup with our Assistant Beauty Therapy Introductory Course. The course also covers other areas of beauty care like skin and hair treatments. It is ideal for anyone who wants to start a career in beauty.\n\nNow, there are two types of job opportunities for makeup artists. You can work as an independent artist or become a specialized makeup artist for films/theatre. As an independent artist, you will have to work with different clients as per their style and preference. Film makeup artists have to design a look for the actors as per the story and characterization in the script. There is a huge demand for talented makeup artists in both these areas.\n\nTo help you get an insider’s view of the industry, we caught up with Natasha Mathias, a makeup artist. In this exclusive interview, Natasha tells us she was training for the IIT entrance exams! Luckily makeup found her. Read on to know her incredible journey and advice for aspiring makeup artists. How did this A+ student learn to score the perfect look? And what does she do to stay inspired in these highly competitive times?\n\n## What, in your opinion, is the most important quality in a makeup artist?\n\nI think that a makeup artist should be able to adapt quickly to any situation, no two clients are the same. Each client has a different need and expectations. Some people like to experiment but some like to stay safe. So, as a makeup artist, you should be able to understand what your client wants. You cannot get too creative with a client who is clearly uncomfortable with it.\n\n### How do you stay updated with the latest trends in makeup?\n\nUpdating myself with the latest makeup trends is fun for me. I love researching online, reading fashion magazines, following all the fashion weeks around the world. I also use Instagram to follow some of the best international makeup artists.\n\n### How do you deal with tough clients?\n\nEvery makeup artist has their style and makeup process. Usually, clients hire you because they like your style. Before I start the makeup, I make it a point to understand what my client wants clearly. But if they were unhappy with the look even then, I’d ask them what they don’t like about it and try and fix it for them. Communication is very important.\n\n### Which is your favorite celebrity makeup look?\n\nPuneet Saini’s style is soo simplistic and fresh that I love all her makeup looks, especially when she works with Alia Bhatt, the fresh-faced no-makeup look.\n\n### Which makeup artists do you look up to?\n\nI absolutely love Puneet Saini, she’s a brilliant artist.\n\n### How did you start your career as a makeup artist?\n\nI loved makeup since childhood. I remember rushing to experiment with my mother’s makeup every time she left the house. But, being a teacher’s daughter, I was always expected to do something big, you know? I was that A+ student who hated studies but was still good at it. I was training for IIT and all the other competitive exams before I decided that I wanted to pursue Advertising. It was while I was doing my BMM that I realized that makeup could be a career option. I started assisting makeup artists and volunteering to do people’s makeup for college fashion shows and events. Before I knew it, I graduated BMM and joined a professional makeup course. After that, there was no looking back!\n\n### What made you pick makeup artist as a career choice?\n\nI could say makeup is in my bones. I thoroughly enjoy it, and I didn’t have to think twice when the opportunity came my way.\n\n### Where did you do your training?\n\nI completed my training from the Fat MU Academy based in Mumbai. I want to say that young aspirants should not underestimate the importance of training. There are many good online makeup courses too.\n\n### What would you advise aspiring young girls who want to become makeup artists like you?\n\nJust make sure you’re in love with what you do, there’s no stopping you then.\n\n### How would you define makeup?\n\nFor me, makeup is fun; it is a form of self-expression.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Blogs and Stories, Make Up Artist, online makeup course, Makeup artist career, online beauty course\n\n",

If being a school teacher is what you aspire to be, then we, at Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation), will help you take the initial steps towards realizing this dream..\n\nWhat does a typical day in a school teacher’s life look like?\n\nAs a teacher, you will not only have to prepare for your classes and teach your students, but will also have to attend trainings and carry out administrative work that your institute assigns to you. Apart from the short duration that they spend within the classroom, the rest of the time is spent doing paperwork, grading students, etc. A school teacher’s is considered one of the best career options in India as they are the only professionals who can avail almost two months of vacation each year.\n\nAccording to school teachers that we spoke with, they spend around 25% of their time in class preparation, 20% time in grading students and paperwork, 10% time for other administrative work, 5% time for parent interaction and rest of the time for other activities. A School Teacher's day starts very early around 7.30 am and ends around 4.30-5 pm depending on the school's timings and her workload of additional responsibilities. In a typical day, you will see a school teacher getting involved in the following activities:\n\n**Preparing for the class**: For a school teacher, preparing for the next day’s lecture is a daily activity. Although he/she might have taught the concept many times before, there will come situations when the theory has been improved or some update has happened in a particular field of study. To keep up with the latest advancements in the teacher’s field of study, it is important that the teacher keeps herself abreast of news in that field. Teaching is one career option that demands constant learning.\n\n**Teaching in the classroom**: Every class in a school might take around 45-60 minutes. During this time, the teacher is expected to teach the students, check their homework, take tests on certain days, etc. On some days, they also try to do some fun activities or interesting experiments in class so that students continue to maintain interest in the subject. To make your classes more effective, you can enroll in an **online course** called [‘](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/course-detail/edX-TeachersCollegeX+EDSCI1x)The Science of Learning: What every teacher should know[’](https://www.fairandlovelyfoundation.in/course-detail/edX-TeachersCollegeX+EDSCI1x) on Glow & Lovely Careers website.\n\n**Grading students’ performance**: This activity might consume a lot of the school teacher’s time.

However, it's also very effective at producing stunning graphics for advertising purposes.\n\nFor beginners, Photoshop can be very intimidating. But only if you attempt to utilise and learn every feature that Photoshop has to offer. Several **Adobe Photoshop online** tutorials and courses are available to teach you how to understand the software.\n\nIf you work in marketing, you may already know how important design is in social media. You need a design to set your content apart from the competition and the crowd and to make it straightforward and easy for your audience to understand the message visually. Long text is boring to read and no longer works on social media.\n\nDesign is essential to social media marketing, from attracting to retaining and convincing your audience to purchase your goods and services.\n\n**Social media post design** is different from designing a website. A social media design must tell a story. Given the decline in the average human attention span, it is the designer's job to ensure that the visual conveys the necessary message to the viewer in the shortest time possible.\n\n## Here are some steps to remember while designing for social media:\n\n### Step 1: Learn the why and what\n\nThe most important thing you should always remember when designing for social media is \"Why and What\". Why am I making this? What message am I trying to give my audience? Once you know your objective, ask yourself: \"What type of design will help convey the message in the simplest manner possible while also making it look appealing and professional?\n\n### Step 2: Get motivated\n\nWhen designing for social media, you can use the 40-60 rule to quickly think through and visualise a design. Drawing ideas and graphics from an existing visual and incorporating your creativity can help you produce a brand-new, eye-catching design.\n\n### Step 3: Working on the background\n\nPlaying with colours and patterns is the key to creating a background design. If you are not using brand colours, be sure to make a wise colour selection. Your background colour selection establishes the tone for the entire visual you create.\n\n### Step 4: Communicating the written message\n\nTypography differs from text because it is more than just the letters and words you type. Typography is the art of placing the letters and text so the reader can read it clearly and enjoy it visually.\n\n### Step 5: 'Visually' communicating the message\n\nAdding images, vectors, icons, and other elements that enhance the post's aesthetic appeal is done in this step.\n\n### Step 6: The final touches\n\nMake a list of mandates before you start designing your **social media graphics** of posts. After creating it, please go through the list and tick off most of it. And only when you are completely satisfied with the results, then post it.\n\n**Photoshop is an online** **tool** that would help you enhance your creative output.

Investigative reports, news, features, columns, and reviews are all ways that journalists use to share information.\n\nJournalists cover two types of news - soft news and hard news. This article covers soft news journalism.\n\n## Soft News Journalism Careers:\n\nSoft news concerns non-serious things such as celebrities, the arts, sports, and culture.** **\n\n#### 1. Arts Journalism:\n\nArts journalism is for people who love art. Arts journalism talks about many different kinds of art, such as music, dance, movies, books, paintings, plays, poems, etc. A journalist for the arts looks at what's happening in the art world and tells people about it. Art journalism is popular with the public, so many news organisations hire art journalists to gather news on the ground.\n\n#### 2. Celebrity journalism:\n\nThe word \"paparazzi\" has become very popular over the past few years. This term is used for journalists who cover famous people. In this field, a journalist's job is to find out about celebrities, whether it's about their personal lives, movies, shows, or public appearances. Fans always want to know what is going on in the lives of the people they look up to, so celebrity journalists also talk to celebrities and report on gossip. A lot of people like to read about and watch shows about their favourite stars.\n\n#### 3. Education Journalism:\n\nEducation journalism reports different development and events in the field of education. These reports help the government to implement new education policies when needed. An education journalist's main job is to spread information about the education system and encourage students to go to college.

Imagine facing adversities three decades ago in India when people were not the most progressive thinkers. But none of this mattered to the hero of this story, Jahnabi Goswami. She is unlike any other superwoman you have ever met.\n\n## Who is Jahnabi Goswami?\n\nJahnabi Goswami, an AIDS survivor and activist, hails from North East India. Back in the 90s, she was the first woman from that region who publicly announced her HIV+ status. She is the founder of ANPP (Assam Network of Positive People). This NGO helps AIDS patients in every way possible. It continuously works towards spreading awareness about the disease too.\n\nJahnabi is also the first woman who became the president of INP+ (Indian Network for People living with HIV/AIDS.)\n\n### The inspiring story of Jahnabi Goswami.\n\nThings have never been easy for Jahnabi Goswami, but she has kept going on and has never looked back. She was married off at the tender age of 17 years to a 46-year-old businessman. Her in-laws kept her in the dark about her husband's HIV positive status. Soon after the marriage, her husband passed away. Unfortunately, her in-laws accused her of being the reason for her husband's death. She was tortured and faced discrimination. She was forced out of her house and did not get to keep her just-born baby girl.\n\nThe doctors later informed Jahnabi that her husband died of HIV. Whatsmore, he had passed the same on to her and her child. Further, Jahnabi learned that she wouldn't live for more than three months. Most people in her position would have given up, but not her. She took legal action and won her daughter's custody. However, merely two years old, the baby girl succumbed to the disease.\n\nThere was no hope left for Jahnabi, but in her saddest moments, she found her purpose. One day Jahnabi's mother expressed that she doesn't want anyone else to suffer like her daughter. Almost three decades later, Jahnabi is daily fighting and winning the battle against the disease. For 28 years, this prominent AIDS activist has been the voice for India's HIV patients.\n\n### The Battle Against AIDS\n\nWhen Jahnabi started ANPP in 2004, she started getting several calls from other HIV+ patients who wanted to understand the Dos and Donts of the disease. So she created a YouTube video in Assamese that helped many who couldn't be vocal about their condition. She continues to make informative videos to help the families of patients. Jahnabi is constantly also working to ensure sex education is provided to everyone in school. Her opinion is that kids right from the fourth-fifth standard should get sex education. While Jahnabi Goswami's has a self-motivated personality, several girls struggle to find their purpose and passion. Such girls can take their first steps towards their dreams by taking a simple [personality test](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in//career-guidance) from Glow & Lovely Careers (formerly known as Fair & Lovely Career Foundation).\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Success Stories, women success stories, Inspiring Stories, women empowerment\n\n",

She grew up in Pant Nagar Chawl in Ghatkopar, Mumbai.\n\nHer humble upbringing never stopped her from having big dreams to serve the people, especially women. That motivated her to complete her MBBS and be a urogynecologist.\n\nShe found purpose in her field and made ‘science, service, and research’ her central focus. With a clear target in mind, she rose to success.\n\nToday, her name is internationally saluted. She is also on Fortune's list of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders of 2021.\n\nShe Serves The Underprivileged Women Of India\n\nAt the time of doing her MBBS, Dr. Aparna felt that women and children were dying in India even though their deaths could be prevented. As a doctor and woman herself, she saw this as a huge problem.\n\nShe wanted to bring change and do something to reduce the number of infant and pregnancy deaths. That’s why she founded ARMMAN.\n\nHer NGO works to take care of pregnant women and their newborn infants. She provides them with proper healthcare facilities regardless of their background.\n\nDr. Aparna believes that welfare work and giving back to the city is important. Hence, she carries out social work through ARMMAN.\n\nShe Uses Technology To Save The Lives Of Women\n\n### Typically, people think that women can’t handle technology. But that’s not true. Dr. Aparna knew technology can do wonders in healthcare. So she started a project called mMitra.\n\nThis project makes sure all patients receive crucial information regarding pregnancy healthcare on their phones. The messages go to her patient’s phones in the language they understand.\n\n#### She uses technology to reach women who live in remote areas.\n\nWhen you face problems, you should try and look for creative ways to solve them. That is exactly what Dr. Aparna did with mMitra.\n\n#### By bringing technology and healthcare together, her NGO has helped over 25 million women in India. In addition, her NGO has also trained 191,651 health workers.\n\n*Like Aparna, if you also dream of making a career in healthcare, it’s a good idea to prepare for your science exams. You can do so by using *[*free exam preparation material*](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/online-courses/filters?fields=healthcare)* on Glow & Lovely Careers.*\n\n### A Covid Warrior During The Pandemic\n\nMany hospitals in India shifted their focus on COVID patients during the pandemic. Pregnant women and their newborns were helpless because of that.\n\nTransport was also closed and women from rural areas couldn’t reach hospitals. This did not discourage Dr. Aparna from her mission. Instead, she started a new project to provide free virtual advice to patients.\n\nHer passion to improve the health of women and children in India didn’t pause even during a worldwide pandemic.\n\nShe delivers babies for mothers who may have COVID. She also does her best to make sure that women and children affected with the virus have a bed in her hospital.\n\nShe puts her life at risk for her patients and raises funds to provide safety equipment for frontline workers. She is truly an inspiration!\n\n### A Leader To Look Up To\n\nDr. Aparna brought a solution for a problem she saw India was suffering from. She has prevented the death of millions of infants and new mothers. Her NGO offers hope to many women in India.\n\nShe is a doctor who didn’t limit herself to saving her patients at the hospital but she also understood how technology can help millions of women in India.\n\nIndia’s job market is evolving rapidly, offering numerous career opportunities across industries suc...\n\njob finder websitejob search website+ 3\n\n**Search Tags:** Free online courses, Professional Courses, Career Options in India, Career opportunity, Online Courses\n\n",
