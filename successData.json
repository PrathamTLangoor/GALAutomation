Everyone would question that I have done my post graduation, I have a master’s degree, now why suddenly change to another profession?\n\n**People would say there are other options for me and why do a teaching job instead of anything else? Answering such a question was a challenge.**These questions somehow made me doubt myself a little, but I still felt that teaching is something I wanted to do.\n\n\n**When these questions made you feel unsure, how did you manage to overcome this challenge?**People’s questions made me want more clarity whether I am on the right track. Then on Facebook I actually saw a [Glow & Lovely Career Test](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) ad.\n\nI said, “Why not give it a try? I want to see what are the possible fields good for my career.” During that test, I got to know that one of the suitable careers for me is teaching.\n\n**Then I felt I am in the right direction, and I don’t have to think about society and the people.** I wanted to go in this direction only.\n\n\n**Glad to know you chose to follow your passion and not worry about society. Now are you happy with your decision?**Yes, I am happy and this is what I want to do. My parents are also supportive of my decision. The [Glow & Lovely Career Test](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) boosted my confidence that I am on the right path.\n\n",

All these things were starting to have a heavy toll on my mental health but thanks to my friend and family’s constant encouragement and support, I decided to use this time productively.Since a very young age, I have felt passionately about fine arts, but somehow I ended pursuing graphic designing instead. It was only when I got the opportunity to work in the field, I realized graphic that graphic design indeed holds my interest. While working there, I also realized that if I follow the path of graphic designer, I can help fulfill my mother’s dream of opening a school one day.Through Glow and lovely Careers portal I found an internship via Internshala, which helped me gain experience in the field of designing. This learning experience I can now use to support my mother’s dream of opening a school. It not only provided me the financial support I have been looking for during the tough times of lockdown but also helped me invest my time effectively.\n## How Internships and Internshala helped young Vaishnavi successfully choose her career\n\n\nMeet Vaishnavi. This young Bachelor of Design student speaks to us about being depressed, how internships are helpful in choosing a career, how Glow and Lovely's Internshala helped her financially and career-wise… and much more!\n\n\n**Thank you, Vaishnavi, for taking time out to speak to us. Can you tell us more about yourself? **Hi! I am Vaishnavi Senthilkumar. I was born in Chennai. Currently, I am a student of Graphic Designing at MIT Institute of Design, Pune.\n\n\n**7 internships in 9 months. And you did that during the Pandemic. That's great. Tell us more about these internships. **During this Pandemic, there was a depressing atmosphere all around. It was easy to slip into depression…\n\nThe distant learning, the burden of fee especially when times are tough. All these things were starting to have a heavy toll on my mental health.\n\nBut thanks to my friend and family's constant encouragement and support, I decided to use this time productively. I applied for internships.\n\n**In 9 months, I did 7 internships! And these internships helped. It helped me solve my confusion about how to go about building my career. **\n\n**So how did these internships actually help you? **As a generation, we have many options in front of us today. It is easy to get confused. In fact, I have wanted to be everything – from being a scientist and aerospace designer to doing something in fine arts, till I decided to get into Design.\n\nBut even in Design, there are options such as Product Design, Interior Space and Furniture Design, Graphic Design, Retail Design and so on!\n\nI had thought of doing Product Design, but I found it too technical. So, I was confused.\n\n**Internships helped me clear that confusion. I realised that Graphic Design suits me better. I like painting and working on a canvas. With graphic design, I realised that whatever I want to do on canvas…I can do it digitally. It helped me decide my career choice.\n\nAnd here, the Glow and Lovely Careers portal proved useful.\n\nThrough Glow and lovely Careers portal, I found an internship via [Internshala](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/searchResult?searchKey=internshala), which helped me gain experience in the field of designing.\n\nThis internship not only provided me with the financial support I have been looking for during the tough times of lockdown but also helped me invest my time effectively.\n\nIt also helped me decide that I want to become a Graphic designer rather than a product designer.  It helped me clear my confusion.\n\n**\n**You know Vaishnavi, you have mentioned a very interesting point about the struggles of students today – choosing a career that suits them. Can you share with us the challenges that you faced when choosing your own career? **Like I said, as a generation, we have so many options in front of us today. It is easy to get confused.\n\nAdd to that the traditional society approach, which focuses on engineering and medical as good careers. Or even architecture.\n\nThis creates a sort of pressure, you know. Not everyone may want to become a doctor or an architect. There are other career options too, which are equally good.\n\nBut there is so much focus on traditional careers that sometimes students don't even know about career options beyond these traditional choices.\n\nIn my case, fine arts, painting… these were my areas of interest. But around me, everyone was focused on traditional careers.\n\nCareer counselling helped me. My parents and I decided to go for career counselling when I was in 11th  because all these things were taking a toll on my health.\n\nBecause of [career counselling](https://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance/career-options), everyone realised that my interest was in Design…. not the traditional careers.\n\nThen my dad did some more research and found out that Design as a career is equally good. That's how I took up Bachelor of Design.\n\n**But, I was still unsure…. because at a young age, I felt passionate about fine arts. A Bachelors of Design is pretty different from Fine Arts. Instead, it was only when I got the opportunity to work in the field, I realised that graphic design indeed holds my interest.**Through Glow and Lovely's website, I found a 6-month internship with Prakriti School as a Graphic Designer via Internshala.\n\nMy other internships also helped me. I got a diverse experience.\n\nToday I know that Graphic Design as a field has a lot of scope. And there are so many job profiles that I can consider – thanks to my degree and the experience I got because of the internships I have done!\n\n",

This helps you to understand how does a company functions. If your work is really good and the company where you intern may also end up offering you a job once you finish your studies!\n- Identify the jobs you like and those you don’t: You get to see and experience the different job roles that may be available for you when you decide to take up a full-time job.\n- You can try different sectors and get exposure: Internships allow you to take up many short-term assignments with different types of companies. Since you are a student, nobody judges you if you make mistakes or if you do not find a job role interesting.

Currently studying Law and an internship with the World Youth Hostel **\n**There are different reasons why students choose to study Law. I am sure you have your own. We would like to hear them.**\nI always dreamt of serving in the Indian Army and giving my people a secure future. However, destiny had different plans.\n\nI faced a severe health issue at a young age, a very uncommon disorder with no cure.\n\nConcerned about my well-being, my family opposed me joining the Army or even choosing the science stream in high school.\n\nI knew if it weren’t for my health, they would never stop me from following my passion. Soon, with a heavy heart, I decided to focus on other fields.\n\nI explored options that would allow me to curb people’s struggles in some way. I thought of Law as a profession then. Law was the field that could help me serve the society I felt. It would help me make a positive difference!\n\nIt would let me make a positive difference to the legal battles at the ground level and society as a whole.\n\nAnd, here I am in 2nd year LLB with a few internships in my pocket. Today, I feel blessed to have chosen this field.\n\n\n**It is evident that you have been incredibly strong until now. Overcoming physical limitations takes a toll on your mental health too. Who were your support pillars throughout your struggle?**\nYes, it was indeed tough. For a while, I thought I compromised on my dreams. But as I dived into my LLB course, I became aware of the vast scope this field offers.\n\nMy family and relatives were my biggest support while I struggled to make the right career decisions.  Internshala also proved to be a huge support for me!\n\n**Can you tell me how did Internshala help? **\nInternships are an integral part of legal studies.\n\nAn online internship with the World Youth Hostel was precisely what I was looking for. And I got it through this website!

As a potential Lawyer, I am keen to gain as much practical experience as I can in my academic years.\n\nI am confident that the World Youth Hostel internship will be monumental for me to win my dream job.\n\n**What kind of work would you like to take up in the future?**\nI eventually want to become a judge. It would be a means to fulfilling my bigger goal of granting justice to people. I would strive to accelerate the legal process in India. Also, I will keep exploring internship and job opportunities that match my interests in the immediate future. LGBT is one such issue that motivates me to put an end to the social stigma around LGBTs and stand up for their equal rights.\n\nThe last we checked, there were more than 10,000 internships available on Internshala.

But there was society pressure on her to consider other career options.With [Glow & Lovely Career's free online psychometric test](http://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance), Riddhi was able to continue her passion fearlessly. Today, she is back to dreaming about getting a PhD in Zoology.\n## How Career Guidance Encouraged Riddhi To Pursue A PhD\n\n\nRiddhi Savoiverekar is a BSc student who loves science but doesn't want to become a doctor as her family wished. She tells us more about her own aspirations to do a PhD and how the [Glow & Lovely Career Portal](http://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) gave her confidence in her decision.\n\n\n**Hi Riddhi, Thank you for taking some time out to speak with us. Would you like to start by telling us more about yourself?**\nYes, sure. I am 20 years old and from Goa. I am in my third year in BSc, which is Bachelors in Science in Zoology.\n\n\n**After your Bachelors, we understand you aspire to do a PhD as well? We wanted to know if there are challenges you face in making this decision? **\nSo my elder sister is doing her MBBS, and everyone in my family was behind me to also become a doctor. From childhood, **I always loved science, but I was never interested in becoming a doctor.**\n\n\nMy parents are supportive of this, but few family members would taunt me to do something to get respect. It was difficult for me to explain to them. I told them that even if I am not becoming a doctor by doing MBBS, **I will do my PhD and still have a doctor next to my name!**\n\n\n**Yes, PhD also gives the title of Doctor! So what do you hope to gain out of your PhD, and what are your aspirations for the future?**\nMy PhD is one thing, and the [Glow and Lovely Careers portal](http://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) helped me acknowledge that pursuing a PhD in Zoology is a promising path towards my ambition of ensuring environmental sustainability.\n\n\nThe [free online psychometric test](http://www.glowandlovelycareers.in/en/career-guidance) also gave me a detailed plan, and that is basically what I used as my guideline and then researched more.\n\n\n**I also want to teach in college or university. Apart from that, I want to write a book, be an author. Alongside that, I also want to travel the world. **\n\n\n**We wish you all the best with your dreams. Could you also tell us more about your experience with Zoology? So that other girls pursuing this can also get an idea of its scope.**\n\n\nZoology is basically studying animals, their behaviour, habitat, conservation, etc. There aren't many youngsters that study a subject like zoology, because the kind of opportunities aren't that vast compared to any other field.\n\n\n**But whatever your field, if you love to do it and excel in your work, the opportunities will knock on your door.**\n\n\nSo choose something you would see yourself doing in the future, something that is going to make a difference, and not only for the economic opportunities.\n\n\n**Are there any career learnings that you'd like to share with others?**\nHaving a basic plan about what you want to do in the future is important. Never let somebody else decide anything for you.\n\n\n**You should do it from your heart, that this is what YOU want to do.** Work for it, do your research by checking online, and take advice from a mentor.\n\n",
